# ANAPHYLAXIS

$~$

Anaphylaxis is a **life-threatening allergic reaction** that requires rapid recognition and immediate treatment with intramuscular **epinephrine**. Despite the availability of clinical guidelines and growing global awareness, the **treatment of anaphylaxis remains inconsistent**, particularly in low-resource settings and underserved regions. Barriers such as lack of access to epinephrine, delays in diagnosis, and inadequate emergency response systems contribute to preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide.

## Addressing Global Inequities in Anaphylaxis Treatment

There is growing recognition of **geographic and structural disparities** in anaphylaxis treatment. Across high-, middle-, and low-income countries, variations in treatment availability, affordability, and healthcare infrastructure lead to unequal outcomes for patients at risk of severe allergic reactions.

My current research is synthesizing global evidence on:

- **International differences** in anaphylaxis treatment and outcomes

- **Access to epinephrine**, including auto-injectors (EAIs) and ampoules

- **Alignment with clinical guidelines** across healthcare systems

- **Barriers to timely care**, including regulatory, cost, and training constraints  

This work aims to inform **policy recommendations** that promote more equitable, evidence-based emergency care for anaphylaxis across global settings.

## Anaphylaxis Treatment in China

My recent work explored **anaphylaxis management in mainland China**, where access to **epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs)** has historically been limited. A focused investigation into the **introduction and integration of EAIs** highlights key findings:

- Challenges in **regulatory approval** and market availability

- **Cost-related barriers** limiting patient and provider uptake

- Gaps in **clinical training** and public awareness

- Opportunities to integrate **global best practices** into national guidelines and emergency protocols


Together, these efforts contribute to a broader understanding of how **health systems can adapt** to improve emergency response capacity for anaphylaxis and ensure that **life-saving interventions are accessible and appropriately used**.

      From Ampoules to Auto-Injectors: Advancing Anaphylaxis Management in China
    </p>

    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      This publication examines the evolving landscape of anaphylaxis treatment in mainland China, with a focus on the introduction of epinephrine auto-injectors. The study highlights persistent challenges such as regulatory barriers, cost constraints, and provider awareness, and offers policy recommendations for integrating standardized, life-saving interventions into emergency response systems.

This research is currently under my leadership, conducted in collaboration with physician and allied health professional partners across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. It reflects a shared commitment to advancing evidence-based, patient-centered approaches to the prevention, recognition, and management of anaphylaxis.
