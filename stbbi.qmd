# SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED AND BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIONS

$~$

Sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain a major global public health concern. Despite increasing awareness, **testing rates for STIs**—such as gonorrhea and chlamydia—remain **low worldwide**, especially among marginalized populations including **men who have sex with men (MSM)**. The underdiagnosis of asymptomatic infections continues to pose a barrier to effective treatment and control.

In **low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)**, multiple factors such as **stigma**, **financial costs**, and **limited access to culturally sensitive services** reduce uptake of testing. In **East Asian contexts**, MSM often face structural exclusion and high levels of stigma, limiting their engagement with formal health systems and contributing to gaps in prevention and care.

## Innovation in STI Testing: Pay-It-Forward and Community Engagement

Emerging **behavioural public health strategies**, such as the **pay-it-forward (PIF) model**, are being evaluated to address these challenges. PIF provides free STI testing to individuals and invites them to voluntarily support others—through donations, messages of encouragement, or other prosocial actions—thus creating a **community-driven model of support and care**.

This approach aims to:

- **Decentralize the financial burden** of STI testing;
- **Foster shared responsibility** in promoting sexual health;
- **Create stigma-sensitive alternatives** to traditional service delivery, particularly in LMICs.

Parallel to this, **community engagement** is conceptualized as voluntary actions that contribute to shared health goals, including advocacy, peer support, and participation in public health activities. Together, PIF and community engagement aim to **enhance STI testing uptake**, especially in hard-to-reach populations.

## Ongoing Research

My current work involves the evaluation of a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** of the pay-it-forward strategy among MSM in China. This includes analysis of:

- **STI testing uptake** across different behavioural intervention arms;
- **Giving behaviours** generated by the PIF model as indicators of community engagement;
- The role of **clinic-level and demographic moderators** in shaping intervention effects;
- A **digital PIF model** integrated with self-sampling to increase accessibility in resource-constrained settings.

This research contributes to growing efforts in understanding how **social innovation and behavioural science** can strengthen public health responses to STBBIs.
