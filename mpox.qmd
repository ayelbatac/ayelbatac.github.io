# MPOX

<p><br></p>

**Mpox** is an emerging zoonotic disease that has re-entered the global spotlight due to recent multi-country outbreaks. Once geographically confined, the current epidemiological landscape is marked by **the rise of new viral clades**, necessitating updated approaches to surveillance, clinical guidance, and risk communication.

Outbreaks have disproportionately affected **gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM)**, and responses have required a balance of urgency, equity, and clarity in public health messaging. Amid this evolving context, my work aims to inform national-level responses in Canada through applied research and knowledge translation.

## Research Focus

As part of my work with the **National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases**, I led a project that sought to strengthen Canadaâ€™s mpox preparedness and response. This work focused on three key domains:

- **Critical assessment of emerging clades**  
  Comprehensive evaluation of novel mpox clades, identifying variations in clinical presentation, disease progression, and transmissibility to inform updated case management and intervention strategies.

- **Epidemiological assessment of case reporting**  
  In-depth analysis of case trends and transmission dynamics to assess the utility of continued case count reporting. This research explored whether routine surveillance remains necessary in light of declining case volumes or shifting transmission risk.

- **Development of public health resources**  
  Designed targeted knowledge translation tools for public health professionals in Canada, integrating the latest evidence on transmission, clinical manifestations, population-specific risks, and therapeutic options.

## Knowledge Translation and Mobilization

This work culminated in the development of a **disease debrief** published by the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases. The debrief serves as a practical, evidence-based guide for public health professionals and primary care physicians, offering up-to-date information on mpox case definitions, transmission trends, and emerging clade characteristics.

## Contribution to Public Health

This mpox research supports public health professionals in navigating a rapidly shifting outbreak landscape, ensuring that response efforts remain **timely**, **evidence-informed**, and **tailored to the populations most at risk**. The work also contributes to broader conversations on how national health systems can proactively adapt to emerging infectious diseases through applied epidemiology and actionable knowledge dissemination.
