# RESEARCH

## RESEARCH SUMMARY

My research centres on the social epidemiology of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs), with a focus on marginalised and underserved populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex worker communities. I am particularly interested in STBBI prevention and control, with an emphasis on the structural, behavioural, and social determinants that shape health inequities.

I also examine infectious disease prevention and response in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and low-resource settings. My current work includes evaluating pay-it-forward models as innovative behavioural interventions to improve access to gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM. I also maintain broader interests in respiratory infections, including tuberculosis (TB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (flu), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While I have growing interests in implementation science and infectious disease modelling, my current focus lies in mixed-methods research, knowledge synthesis, and epidemiological analysis. I am actively engaged in knowledge translation (KT) and knowledge mobilisation (KMb) efforts to bridge research with policy and practice, ensuring that evidence informs real-world decision-making.

In addition to my work in infectious diseases, I have a longstanding interest in allergy and clinical immunology, particularly in the areas of paediatric allergy and immunology, allergen immunotherapy, and the health economics of allergy medications. I am also interested in the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of HIV prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
