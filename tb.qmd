# TUBERCULOSIS

$~$

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern in remote Arctic communities across Canada, where incidence rates are consistently the highest in the country. Despite long-standing efforts to control and eliminate the disease, TB continues to re-emerge in the form of outbreaks, particularly in geographically isolated settings where social and structural challenges persist.

In these contexts, barriers such as **limited access to healthcare**, **overcrowded housing**, and **long-standing distrust in public health systems** undermine prevention and control efforts. These challenges are often compounded by logistical obstacles—such as seasonal mobility, infrastructure limitations, and staff turnover—that constrain timely diagnosis and treatment.

## Community-Wide Screening as a Public Health Strategy

One of the most promising interventions to disrupt TB transmission in high-burden regions is **community-wide screening (CWS)**. This approach involves proactively offering screening to all members of a community—regardless of symptoms—to detect both **latent TB infection (LTBI)** and **active TB disease**.

The benefits of CWS include:

- **Reducing time to diagnosis**, thereby interrupting transmission chains;
- **Identifying latent infections** before they progress to active disease;
- **Providing culturally adapted outreach and education** to increase participation;
- **Strengthening community trust** through local leadership and engagement.

Previous implementations of CWS in Nunavut, Canada, have demonstrated both effectiveness and cost-efficiency when adapted to local realities. When combined with targeted health promotion and community-driven planning, these initiatives support early detection, treatment uptake, and long-term disease control.

## Ongoing Research

My current work focuses on the **evaluation of a CWS** clinic conducted in response to a TB outbreak in Nunavut. This evaluation examines how the initiative:

- Detected and treated both active and latent TB cases;
- Promoted awareness and reduced stigma through bilingual outreach;
- Addressed barriers to participation and treatment completion;
- Applied lessons from previous CWS efforts to strengthen delivery.

This research contributes to operational knowledge on how community-based strategies can strengthen TB prevention and control in remote, high-incidence regions.
