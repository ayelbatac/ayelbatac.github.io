# Let’s Talk About STBBIs: What They Are, Why They Matter, and What You Can Do

May 10, 2025

$~$

Sexual health is a part of health — full stop.
Yet even in 2025, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain heavily stigmatized, misunderstood, and under-discussed. And because we don't talk about them enough, we allow misinformation, fear, and shame to take the place of facts, care, and prevention.

This blog post is my small way of changing that — by starting with the basics, and by sharing some of my own perspective.

### What Are STBBIs?

STBBIs — short for *sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections* — are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. They can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, as well as through needle sharing, blood transfusions (where screening is limited), or from a birthing parent to child during pregnancy or childbirth.

Some of the most common STBBIs include:

- HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)

- Chlamydia

- Gonorrhea

- Syphilis

- Hepatitis B and C

- HPV (Human Papillomavirus)

- Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2)

Each of these infections is different — in symptoms, transmission, and treatment — but they share one thing in common: **they’re all manageable, preventable, and in many cases, treatable**.

### How Common Are STBBIs?

Very common — more common than most people think.
According to the WHO, more than **1 million STIs** are acquired every day worldwide. Many people living with STBBIs don’t even know they have one, because symptoms are often mild or absent. That’s why testing is so important.

The reality is: **if you’re sexually active, you could be at risk** — regardless of age, gender, relationship status, or sexual orientation.

### Why Should We Care?

STBBIs don’t always cause symptoms right away. But left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences:

- Infertility

- Chronic pain

- Liver disease and cancer (especially from hepatitis B and C)

- Neurological complications

- Increased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV

For pregnant individuals, some STBBIs can lead to complications like miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital infections passed on to the baby.

But here's the good news: **Most STBBIs can be easily tested for, and many can be cured or effectively managed with treatment**. Early detection truly makes all the difference.

### A Personal Perspective: Living Between Two Worlds

As someone who has lived in both a high-income country like **Canada** and a lower-middle-income country like the **Philippines**, I’ve seen firsthand the contrast in how sexual health is treated, taught, and accessed.

In **Canada**, I was fortunate to receive **comprehensive sexual education** in high school. We were taught about family planning methods like condoms and birth control pills, how to access them, and even how to use them properly. I still remember the condom demonstration using a model — a moment filled with nervous laughter from students, but also one that left a lasting impression. That education, awkward or not, was useful — and lifesaving.

Canada’s public health system also provides access to **free sexual health clinics**, where youth — including young girls — can access **contraceptives**, **STBBI testing**, and counselling without stigma or barriers. We were taught how to **test**, why it matters to know our status, and how to protect ourselves through safer sex or abstinence.

In the **Philippines**, the contrast is stark. Sexual health remains a **deeply taboo topic**, especially in schools and within families. Comprehensive sexual education is rare, and public conversations around STBBIs are even rarer. Access to testing, treatment, and prevention tools like PrEP or even condoms can be limited — not just logistically, but culturally. The silence is loud, and the stigma can be overwhelming.

That contrast continues to fuel my commitment to public health. Because education should not be a luxury. Testing should not be a privilege. And silence should never be the barrier that keeps people from knowing their status and protecting themselves.

### What’s Holding Us Back?

The biggest barriers aren’t scientific — they’re social.

Many people delay or avoid testing not because they lack access, but because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of what others might think. Fear of being associated with something “dirty” or “irresponsible.”

That stigma can be even more intense in communities where sex is rarely discussed openly. I’ve seen this play out personally — especially in Southeast Asian and religious contexts. But staying silent only allows the problem to grow.

The truth is, **STBBIs don’t discriminate**. They can affect anyone, regardless of how many partners you’ve had, how careful you are, or who you are. Risk isn’t about identity — it’s about biology and behavior, and more importantly, about access to information and care.

### What You Can Do: Take Care, Without Shame

Here’s what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other:

- **Get tested regularly**. If you’re sexually active, routine testing is part of responsible healthcare — just like going to the dentist or getting a physical.

- **Use protection**. Condoms and dental dams help prevent many STBBIs. They’re not perfect, but they’re effective.

- **Know your options**. Vaccines exist for HPV and hepatitis B. HIV prevention tools like PrEP and PEP are life-changing for many.

- **Talk about it**. Honest conversations with partners — and within our communities — can break down stigma and build trust.

- **Get informed**. The more we understand, the less room there is for shame.

### A Final Word: Knowledge Is Power, and Silence Is a Risk We Can’t Afford

Talking about STBBIs shouldn’t be controversial — it should be **standard practice**. These infections are common, treatable, and preventable. Yet every day, people are put at risk not because they lack protection, but because they lack **information**, **access**, and **support**.

I’ve seen how the silence around sexual health can cause real harm.
I’ve lived in systems that empower people to make informed choices — and systems that shame them into silence. And I can tell you this: **when we stay quiet, we don’t keep people safe — we leave them behind**.

But we can choose something different.

We can choose to create communities where talking about sexual health is a sign of care, not shame.
We can choose to push for better education, stronger services, and a healthcare system that leaves no one out.
We can choose to get tested, get informed, and speak up — not just for ourselves, but for those who can’t yet do so safely.

**Because knowledge is more than power — it’s protection. It’s freedom. And it’s a form of love.**

Thank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.
