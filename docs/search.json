    "text": "\\(~\\)\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain a major global public health concern. Despite increasing awareness, testing rates for STIs—such as gonorrhea and chlamydia—remain low worldwide, especially among marginalized populations including men who have sex with men (MSM). The underdiagnosis of asymptomatic infections continues to pose a barrier to effective treatment and control.\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), multiple factors such as stigma, financial costs, and limited access to culturally sensitive services reduce uptake of testing. In East Asian contexts, MSM often face structural exclusion and high levels of stigma, limiting their engagement with formal health systems and contributing to gaps in prevention and care.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward (PIF) model is a social innovation approach that blends public health delivery with prosocial behaviour. In the context of STI testing, PIF offers individuals a free service—such as testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia—and then invites them to support someone else’s access through voluntary donations or encouraging messages.\nThe model is built on three core pillars:\n\nAccess: Removing cost barriers to testing\nAltruism: Harnessing the human tendency to give back after receiving support\nCommunity engagement: Fostering collective responsibility for health and well-being\n\nUnlike traditional models of subsidized or fee-for-service health care, PIF decentralizes financial burden while embedding a sense of solidarity and empowerment. It is especially valuable in contexts where stigma, mistrust of institutions, or cost inhibits access to care.\n\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward (PIF) model represents more than just an access intervention—it is a social innovation strategy designed to reimagine how STI services are delivered and experienced. When combined with community engagement, PIF helps foster environments where testing is accessible, stigma-sensitive, and rooted in mutual support.\nCommunity engagement in this context refers to voluntary, health-promoting actions—such as anonymous messaging, advocacy, or participation in public health initiatives—that reinforce the goals of PIF. Together, these approaches seek to:\n\nEmpower individuals to take collective ownership of sexual health\nBuild trust between communities and health systems\nExpand reach and uptake of STI services, particularly in LMIC settings\n\n\n\n\nMy current work involves the evaluation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the pay-it-forward strategy among MSM in China. This includes:\n\nAssessing STI testing uptake across different behavioural intervention arms\nAnalyzing giving behaviours as markers of engagement and reciprocity\nIdentifying clinic-level and demographic factors that influence outcomes\nTesting a digital version of the PIF model integrated with self-sampling to improve accessibility in low-resource settings\n\nThis research contributes to growing efforts to understand how social innovation and behavioural science can strengthen public health responses to STBBIs by expanding testing reach, building community resilience, and reframing how health systems engage with stigmatized populations.\n\n\n\nTo fully understand both the impact and implementation of the PIF model, this research uses a mixed methods design:\n\nQuantitative evaluation through randomized controlled trials tracks behavioural outcomes, including uptake and donation patterns\nQualitative interviews with participants and providers explore perceived barriers, motivations for giving, and emotional responses to the intervention\nProcess evaluations assess feasibility, fidelity, and scalability in real-world settings\n\nThis integration of methods helps generate both rigorous evidence and context-specific insights that are essential for scale-up and adaptation.\n\n\n\nThis research contributes to reimagining STI testing as a more equitable, effective, and empowering element of public health delivery. Key public health contributions include:\n\nDemonstrating how decentralized, community-driven financing models can sustainably expand access to essential services\nAdvancing stigma-sensitive, culturally tailored approaches to testing that are attuned to the lived experiences of MSM and other marginalized groups\nInforming health system strategies that align social innovation with service delivery, helping to bridge the gap between clinic-based care and community realities\nContributing to global conversations on universal health coverage, equity, and the integration of sexual health into broader public health systems\n\nBy positioning STI testing as a collective act of care—rather than an individual burden—this research helps build a more inclusive foundation for sexual health equity.\n\\(~\\)\n\\(~\\)\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon."

    "text": "U = U: The Science, the Message, and Why It Matters\nMay 23, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhat if one of the most powerful tools we have to stop HIV transmission is something most people have never even heard of?\nIt’s called U=U — short for Undetectable = Untransmittable — and it means that a person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and maintains an undetectable viral load cannot pass the virus to others through sex. Not “reduced risk.” Not “less likely.” Zero transmission.\nThis isn’t just a message of hope — it’s a message of science. And it has the power to change how we think about HIV, how we support those who live with it, and how we end stigma once and for all.\n\nWhat Does U=U Actually Mean?\nWhen someone living with HIV takes antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently, the amount of virus in their body drops to such low levels that it becomes undetectable on standard blood tests. The virus isn’t cured — but it is controlled.\nAnd here’s the most important part: when HIV is undetectable, it cannot be passed on sexually.\nThis is not a theory. It’s a fact, confirmed by some of the most significant research studies in HIV science:\n\n🧪 HPTN 052 Study (2011)\nThis groundbreaking clinical trial followed over 1,700 mostly heterosexual couples across multiple continents. One partner in each couple was HIV-positive. The study compared couples where the HIV-positive partner started treatment early with those who delayed treatment.\nOnly one linked transmission occurred in the early treatment group, and it happened shortly after therapy began. In contrast, 27 linked transmissions occurred in the delayed treatment group. This resulted in a 96% reduction in risk — one of the first and strongest proofs that ART can prevent transmission.\n\nRead the HPTN 052 Study Here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER Study (2016)\nThis European study followed 888 couples (340 gay male and 548 heterosexual) where one partner was HIV-positive and on effective ART. Over 1,238 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported tens of thousands of condomless sex acts.\nNo HIV transmissions occurred between partners. Of the 11 infections observed, genetic testing confirmed all came from outside the primary relationship. The takeaway? When someone is on ART and virally suppressed, they don’t transmit HIV — even without condoms.\n\nRead the PARTNER Study Here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER2 Study (2019)\nThis follow-up study focused exclusively on gay male couples — a group often considered at higher risk for HIV transmission. Over 1,593 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported about 76,088 acts of condomless anal sex while the HIV-positive partner had a suppressed viral load.\nAgain, no HIV transmissions occurred. This study confirmed what PARTNER1 had shown and extended it to even the highest-risk types of sex: U=U holds true, even during anal sex among MSM partners.\nThese three landmark studies give us what is rare in public health: definitive evidence. People living with HIV who are undetectable cannot transmit the virus through sex. Full stop.\n\nRead the PARTNER2 Study Here\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Message Matters\nImagine being in a relationship, taking your medication every day, and knowing — with confidence — that you cannot transmit HIV to the person you love. That’s the kind of peace and freedom U=U makes possible.\nBut for too long, HIV has been surrounded by fear, misunderstanding, and silence. Many people still hold outdated ideas — that HIV can be passed through hugging, sharing food, or being near someone living with the virus. These misconceptions are not just wrong; they isolate people and fuel stigma.\nU=U tells a different story. A story based in science. It reminds us that with access to treatment and care, people living with HIV can enjoy full, loving, and healthy lives. They can be intimate, have families, and move through the world without fear of harming others — because they can’t transmit the virus when undetectable.\nThis knowledge is not only medically important — it’s emotionally and socially liberating.\n\n\nFrom Science to Society: Where We Stand Now\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, U=U is still not widely communicated. In many parts of the world, healthcare workers may not mention it, patients may not be aware of it, and systems may not support the testing and treatment access needed to achieve undetectable status.\nStigma continues to be one of the biggest obstacles. Too many people living with HIV are still judged unfairly, discriminated against, or made to feel unsafe — even when they pose no risk to others.\nThis is why sharing U=U matters so deeply. It challenges fear with facts. It replaces shame with dignity. And it builds a foundation of trust — between people, partners, and health systems.\n\n\nU=U and the Bigger Picture of HIV Prevention\nU=U is a major breakthrough, but it’s part of a broader strategy for HIV prevention. Other essential tools include:\n\nRoutine HIV testing\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV-negative individuals\nCondoms and harm reduction programs\nSupportive, stigma-free care environments\n\nWhen these tools work together, they help create communities where HIV is no longer something to fear, but something we know how to manage — together.\n\n\nEquity and Access Still Matter\nIt’s important to acknowledge that not everyone has equal access to ART, viral load monitoring, or supportive healthcare. In many low- and middle-income countries — and even in marginalized communities within high-income ones — systemic barriers still limit what’s possible.\nThat’s why U=U must go hand-in-hand with efforts to ensure universal access to treatment, routine testing, and public education. This message is only as powerful as it is reachable.\nEveryone deserves the opportunity to be undetectable — and untransmittable.\n\n\nFeaturing the Message: U=U in One Glance\nTo support the points discussed above, the following infographic provides a clear and accessible summary of what U=U means and why it matters. It’s a helpful visual to reinforce key information and support understanding:\n\nThis image highlights several core takeaways:\n\nWhat “undetectable” means: With effective HIV treatment, the virus is suppressed so low it can’t be detected by standard tests — this is called having an undetectable viral load.\nWhat it means for prevention: A person with an undetectable viral load cannot pass HIV through sex. This is not just reassuring — it’s scientifically proven.\n\n\n\nWhy This Changes Everything\nSo what does this all mean for us, right now?\nThis message isn’t just about reducing risk — it’s about changing lives:\n\n✅ U=U reduces stigma by replacing fear with facts. When people know that those with undetectable HIV cannot transmit the virus, it chips away at the misinformation that fuels rejection and discrimination.\n✅ It encourages treatment and testing by showing that knowing your status and accessing ART has both personal and public benefits.\n✅ It builds trust in public health by demonstrating how scientific evidence can empower people, not just diagnose them.\n✅ It empowers people living with HIV to live openly, form relationships, and plan families — all without fear of transmission.\n\nBut while U=U addresses HIV prevention, it’s also important to remember:\n\n🛡️ PrEP protects only against HIV — not other STIs.\n\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a powerful tool that helps HIV-negative individuals stay HIV-negative. But it does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections. That means protection like condoms still plays a key role — especially when it comes to preventing infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis B or C.\n\n⚠️ U=U doesn’t prevent other STBBIs.\n\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and others can still be transmitted, even when HIV is undetectable. That’s why using condoms consistently and correctly remains essential. Condoms offer strong protection not only against HIV but also against a wide range of STIs and STBBIs.\nBy combining strategies like U=U, PrEP, and especially consistent condom use, individuals can build a well-rounded approach to sexual health that protects not only against HIV, but also against a wide range of other STBBIs — fostering both physical health and human dignity.\nBeing undetectable changes what’s possible — but a comprehensive approach to sexual health is what keeps everyone safe, healthy, and respected.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nLet’s be absolutely clear:\n\nA person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and has an undetectable viral load cannot transmit the virus sexually.\nThis truth is backed by science, supported by real-world evidence, and endorsed by leading global health organizations.\nU=U is a public health breakthrough — and a message of hope, equity, and human dignity.\n\nThe more we share this message, the more we break down stigma, build trust, and empower people — no matter their status.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"

    "text": "Why I Work in HIV and STBBIs: A Personal and Professional Journey\nMay 7, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhen I began studying molecular biology as an undergraduate, I carried with me a deep sense of purpose. Like many students entering the life sciences, I was driven by a dream — to one day help cure cancer. I believed that if I could just understand disease at its most fundamental level, I could be part of the solution to one of the world’s greatest medical challenges.\nWhat captivated me most was the human body itself — its elegance, its complexity. Even in a state of health, it felt like an intricate puzzle. But the moment pathology entered the picture, that complexity multiplied. I remember thinking how difficult it was to grasp the body’s inner workings even when nothing was wrong — how much more difficult, then, when disease was involved. That realization gave me a new kind of respect for the scientific process, and also, quietly, a sense of doubt.\nAs I progressed in my studies, that doubt grew. Despite decades of research and extraordinary investment, cancer remains without a cure. The more I learned, the more I understood that science — as powerful and beautiful as it is — doesn’t always move at the pace of our hopes. I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.\nFortunately, I had the chance to step outside the lab and explore something new.\nI began working as a research assistant at the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, contributing to studies in population health, allergy, and clinical immunology. It was there that I got my first glimpse into the world of public health — and it shifted everything. I saw how public health wasn’t just about understanding disease, but about preventing it, supporting communities, and creating conditions where people could thrive. It wasn’t abstract. It was immediate, and it was deeply human.\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.\nI was given the opportunity to work as an infectious disease epidemiologist for the Government of Manitoba. In that role, I collaborated with epidemiologists, public health advisors, laboratory scientists, and medical officers of health. Together, we faced an unfolding crisis, with decisions needing to be made in real time. The work was urgent, collaborative, and fast-paced — and for the first time, I felt like I had found where I belonged.\nUnlike non-communicable diseases, which often require slow, long-term strategies, infectious diseases demand immediate action. They require basic science, clinical insight, and social understanding to come together — and that balance resonated with me. The field touched everything I cared about: biology, policy, data, and, most of all, people.\nAfter my experience with COVID-19, my attention turned to another crisis — one that had been ongoing for decades, but still demanded far more action: HIV and sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs).\nFrom my molecular biology background, I knew how formidable HIV is as a virus. Its ability to mutate — thanks to its error-prone reverse transcriptase — makes it extremely difficult to treat permanently or prevent with a long-lasting vaccine. A cure remains elusive. But I also knew that despite the scientific challenges, we already have the tools to control HIV. What’s missing, too often, is access, education, and equity.\nSo I made a quiet promise to myself:\nIf I can’t cure HIV, then I will help contain it.\nThis work became even more personal to me when I reflected on where I came from. Growing up in an Asian community, I saw how sexual health was often considered shameful — something not to be talked about, let alone prioritized. In the Philippines, where I have deep ties, HIV incidence has been rising, especially among young people and men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite progress in many parts of the world, stigma continues to be one of the greatest barriers to prevention and care in Southeast Asia.\nBut the issue isn’t just cultural — it’s systemic.\nI think about the individuals who are afraid to get tested, not because they lack information, but because they fear judgment. I think about the communities that are left behind, blamed, or ignored. And I think about those who are forced to make unimaginable choices simply to survive.\nWhen I was just seven years old, I already knew of children my age who were selling sex. Not out of choice, but out of desperation — to afford school, to put food on the table, to care for their families. That reality has stayed with me ever since. It planted something in me — a quiet fire that still burns.\nI dedicate my work to those children.\nTo those who had no childhood, no protection, and no choice. They deserved better, and they still do.\nNow, as a graduate student at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, I’ve found a path that allows me to combine my scientific training with advocacy, compassion, and community. Through my work in HIV and STBBIs, I aim to contribute to a world where public health is not only evidence-based, but people-centered.\nMy goal is not just to publish academic papers. I want to translate knowledge into impact — whether that’s through infographics that explain complex concepts, educational materials that reach underserved communities, or accessible writing like this blog. This site is a space where I share what I’m learning and working on, and where I hope others can learn, too.\nMost importantly, it’s a space to keep asking the questions that matter:\n\nHow do we reduce transmission — not just scientifically, but equitably?\nHow do we support people living with HIV — medically, emotionally, and socially?\nHow do we dismantle the stigma that continues to surround sexual health?\n\nPublic health is not value-free. It is shaped by politics, by power, and by systems — and that’s what makes it both complicated and necessary. I don’t have all the answers. But I know I want to be part of the effort to ask better questions, to listen more carefully, and to act more boldly.\nThank you for being here — and for caring about this work, too.\n-Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s Talk About STBBIs: What They Are, Why They Matter, and What You Can Do\nMay 10, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nSexual health is a part of health — full stop. Yet even in 2025, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain heavily stigmatized, misunderstood, and under-discussed. And because we don’t talk about them enough, we allow misinformation, fear, and shame to take the place of facts, care, and prevention.\nThis blog post is my small way of changing that — by starting with the basics, and by sharing some of my own perspective.\n\nWhat Are STBBIs?\nSTBBIs — short for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections — are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. They can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, as well as through needle sharing, blood transfusions (where screening is limited), or from a birthing parent to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\nSome of the most common STBBIs include:\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)\nChlamydia\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\nHepatitis B and C\nHPV (Human Papillomavirus)\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2)\n\nEach of these infections is different — in symptoms, transmission, and treatment — but they share one thing in common: they’re all manageable, preventable, and in many cases, treatable.\n\n\nHow Common Are STBBIs?\nVery common — more common than most people think. According to the WHO, more than 1 million STIs are acquired every day worldwide. Many people living with STBBIs don’t even know they have one, because symptoms are often mild or absent. That’s why testing is so important.\nThe reality is: if you’re sexually active, you could be at risk — regardless of age, gender, relationship status, or sexual orientation.\n\n\nWhy Should We Care?\nSTBBIs don’t always cause symptoms right away. But left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences:\n\nInfertility\nChronic pain\nLiver disease and cancer (especially from hepatitis B and C)\nNeurological complications\nIncreased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV\n\nFor pregnant individuals, some STBBIs can lead to complications like miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital infections passed on to the baby.\nBut here’s the good news: Most STBBIs can be easily tested for, and many can be cured or effectively managed with treatment. Early detection truly makes all the difference.\n\n\nA Personal Perspective: Living Between Two Worlds\nAs someone who has lived in both a high-income country like Canada and a lower-middle-income country like the Philippines, I’ve seen firsthand the contrast in how sexual health is treated, taught, and accessed.\nIn Canada, I was fortunate to receive comprehensive sexual education in high school. We were taught about family planning methods like condoms and birth control pills, how to access them, and even how to use them properly. I still remember the condom demonstration using a model — a moment filled with nervous laughter from students, but also one that left a lasting impression. That education, awkward or not, was useful — and lifesaving.\nCanada’s public health system also provides access to free sexual health clinics, where youth — including young girls — can access contraceptives, STBBI testing, and counselling without stigma or barriers. We were taught how to test, why it matters to know our status, and how to protect ourselves through safer sex or abstinence.\nIn the Philippines, the contrast is stark. Sexual health remains a deeply taboo topic, especially in schools and within families. Comprehensive sexual education is rare, and public conversations around STBBIs are even rarer. Access to testing, treatment, and prevention tools like PrEP or even condoms can be limited — not just logistically, but culturally. The silence is loud, and the stigma can be overwhelming.\nThat contrast continues to fuel my commitment to public health. Because education should not be a luxury. Testing should not be a privilege. And silence should never be the barrier that keeps people from knowing their status and protecting themselves.\n\n\nWhat’s Holding Us Back?\nThe biggest barriers aren’t scientific — they’re social.\nMany people delay or avoid testing not because they lack access, but because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of what others might think. Fear of being associated with something “dirty” or “irresponsible.”\nThat stigma can be even more intense in communities where sex is rarely discussed openly. I’ve seen this play out personally — especially in Southeast Asian and religious contexts. But staying silent only allows the problem to grow.\nThe truth is, STBBIs don’t discriminate. They can affect anyone, regardless of how many partners you’ve had, how careful you are, or who you are. Risk isn’t about identity — it’s about biology and behavior, and more importantly, about access to information and care.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do: Take Care, Without Shame\nHere’s what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other:\n\nGet tested regularly. If you’re sexually active, routine testing is part of responsible healthcare — just like going to the dentist or getting a physical.\nUse protection. Condoms and dental dams help prevent many STBBIs. They’re not perfect, but they’re effective.\nKnow your options. Vaccines exist for HPV and hepatitis B. HIV prevention tools like PrEP and PEP are life-changing for many.\nTalk about it. Honest conversations with partners — and within our communities — can break down stigma and build trust.\nGet informed. The more we understand, the less room there is for shame.\n\n\n\nA Final Word: Knowledge Is Power, and Silence Is a Risk We Can’t Afford\nTalking about STBBIs shouldn’t be controversial — it should be standard practice. These infections are common, treatable, and preventable. Yet every day, people are put at risk not because they lack protection, but because they lack information, access, and support.\nI’ve seen how the silence around sexual health can cause real harm. I’ve lived in systems that empower people to make informed choices — and systems that shame them into silence. And I can tell you this: when we stay quiet, we don’t keep people safe — we leave them behind.\nBut we can choose something different.\nWe can choose to create communities where talking about sexual health is a sign of care, not shame. We can choose to push for better education, stronger services, and a healthcare system that leaves no one out. We can choose to get tested, get informed, and speak up — not just for ourselves, but for those who can’t yet do so safely.\nBecause knowledge is more than power — it’s protection. It’s freedom. And it’s a form of love.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"

    "text": "Mpox is an emerging zoonotic disease that has re-entered the global spotlight due to recent multi-country outbreaks. Once geographically confined, the current epidemiological landscape is marked by the rise of new viral clades, necessitating updated approaches to surveillance, clinical guidance, and risk communication.\nOutbreaks have disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), and responses have required a balance of urgency, equity, and clarity in public health messaging. Amid this evolving context, my work aims to inform national-level responses in Canada through applied research and knowledge translation.\n\n\nAs part of my research work with the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases, I led a project that sought to strengthen Canada’s mpox preparedness and response. This work focused on three key domains:\n\nCritical Assessment of Emerging Clades\nComprehensive evaluation of novel mpox clades, identifying variations in clinical presentation, disease progression, and transmissibility to inform updated case management and intervention strategies.\nEpidemiological Assessment of Case Reporting\nIn-depth analysis of case trends and transmission dynamics to assess the utility of continued case count reporting. This research explored whether routine surveillance remains necessary in light of declining case volumes or shifting transmission risk.\nDevelopment of Public Health Resources\nDesigned targeted knowledge translation tools for public health professionals in Canada, integrating the latest evidence on transmission, clinical manifestations, population-specific risks, and therapeutic options.\n\n\n\n\nThis work culminated in the development of a national mpox disease debrief published by the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases. The debrief serves as a practical, evidence-based guide for public health professionals and primary care physicians, offering up-to-date information on mpox case definitions, transmission trends, and emerging clade characteristics.\n\n  Featured Resource\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    Mpox Disease Debrief\n\n    \n      A knowledge translation resource for Canadian public health professionals, this debrief synthesizes current evidence on mpox epidemiology, emerging clades, and clinical guidance for frontline response and risk communication.\n    \n\n    \n      \n        View the Mpox Disease Debrief ›\n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\\(~\\)\n\n\n\nThis mpox research supports public health professionals in navigating a rapidly shifting outbreak landscape, ensuring that response efforts remain timely, evidence-informed, and tailored to the populations most at risk.
