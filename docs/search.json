    "text": "\\(~\\)\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain a major global public health concern. Despite increasing awareness, testing rates for STIs—such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia—remain low worldwide, especially among marginalized populations including men who have sex with men (MSM). Asymptomatic infections often go undiagnosed, posing a barrier to timely treatment and effective disease control.\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), multiple factors—such as stigma, financial costs, and limited access to culturally responsive services—reduce uptake of testing. In many settings, MSM face structural exclusion and persistent stigma, which limit their engagement with formal health systems and contribute to ongoing gaps in prevention and care.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward model is a social innovation approach that combines public health service delivery with prosocial behaviour. In the context of STI testing, the pay-it-forward model offers individuals a free service—such as testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia—and then invites them to support someone else’s access to the same service through voluntary donations or encouraging messages.\nThe model is built on three core pillars:\n\nAccess: Removing cost barriers to testing\n\nAltruism: Harnessing the human tendency to give back after receiving support\n\nCommunity engagement: Fostering collective responsibility for health and well-being\n\nUnlike traditional models of subsidised or fee-for-service health care, the pay-it-forward model shifts the financial burden away from centralized systems and fosters a sense of solidarity and empowerment. It is particularly valuable in settings where stigma, mistrust of institutions, or financial barriers limit access to care.\n\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward model is more than an access intervention—it is a social innovation strategy that reimagines how STI services are delivered and experienced. When paired with community engagement, the pay-it-forward approach helps create environments where testing is accessible, sensitive to stigma, and grounded in mutual support.\nIn this context, community engagement refers to voluntary, health-promoting actions—such as anonymous messaging, advocacy, and participation in public health initiatives—that align with and reinforce the goals of the pay-it-forward model. Together, these approaches aim to:\n\nEmpower individuals to take collective ownership of sexual health\n\nBuild trust between communities and health systems\n\nExpand reach and uptake of STI services, particularly in LMIC settings\n\n\n\n\nMy current work involves the evaluation of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the pay-it-forward strategy among MSM in China. This includes:\n\nAssessing STI testing uptake across different behavioural intervention arms\n\nAnalyzing giving behaviours as markers of engagement and reciprocity\n\nIdentifying clinic-level and demographic factors that influence outcomes\n\nTesting a digital version of the pay-it-forward model integrated with self-sampling to improve accessibility in low-resource settings\n\nThis research contributes to growing efforts to understand how social innovation and behavioural science can strengthen public health responses to STBBIs by expanding testing reach, building community resilience, and reframing how health systems engage with stigmatised populations.\n\n\n\nTo fully understand both the impact and implementation of the pay-it-forward model, this research uses a mixed methods design:\n\nQuantitative evaluation through randomised controlled trials tracks behavioural outcomes, including uptake and donation patterns\n\nQualitative interviews with participants and providers explore perceived barriers, motivations for giving, and emotional responses to the intervention\n\nProcess evaluations assess feasibility, fidelity, and scalability in real-world settings\n\nThis integration of methods helps generate both rigorous evidence and context-specific insights that are essential for scale-up and adaptation.\n\n\n\nThis research contributes to reimagining STI testing as a more equitable, effective, and empowering element of public health delivery. Key public health contributions include:\n\nDemonstrating how decentralized, community-driven financing models can sustainably expand access to essential services\n\nAdvancing stigma-sensitive, culturally tailored approaches to testing that are attuned to the lived experiences of MSM and other marginalized groups\n\nInforming health system strategies that align social innovation with service delivery, helping to bridge the gap between clinic-based care and community realities\n\nContributing to global conversations on universal health coverage, equity, and the integration of sexual health into broader public health systems\n\nBy positioning STI testing as a collective act of care—rather than an individual burden—this research helps build a more inclusive foundation for sexual health equity.\n\\(~\\)\n\\(~\\)\nStay tuned — publications and data visualisations related to this work will be made available here soon."

    "text": "\\(~\\)\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern in remote Arctic communities across Canada, where incidence rates are consistently the highest in the country. Despite long-standing efforts to control and eliminate the disease, TB continues to re-emerge in the form of outbreaks, particularly in geographically isolated settings where social and structural challenges persist.\nIn these contexts, barriers such as limited access to healthcare, overcrowded housing, and long-standing distrust in public health systems undermine prevention and control efforts. These challenges are often compounded by logistical obstacles—such as seasonal mobility, infrastructure limitations, and staff turnover—that constrain timely diagnosis and treatment.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nOne of the most promising interventions to disrupt TB transmission in high-burden regions is community-wide screening. This approach involves proactively offering screening to all members of a community—regardless of symptoms—to detect both latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.\nThe benefits of community-wide screening include:\n\nReducing time to diagnosis, thereby interrupting transmission chains\n\nIdentifying latent infections before they progress to active disease\n\nProviding culturally adapted outreach and education to increase participation\n\nStrengthening community trust through local leadership and engagement\n\nPrevious implementations of community-wide screening in Nunavut, Canada, have demonstrated both effectiveness and cost-efficiency when adapted to local realities. When combined with targeted health promotion and community-driven planning, these initiatives support early detection, treatment uptake, and long-term disease control.\n\n\n\nMy current work focuses on the evaluation of a community-wide screening clinic conducted in response to a TB outbreak in Nunavut.

Program data were analysed to examine screening coverage, diagnostic outcomes, and treatment initiation for both active TB and LTBI.\nThe study also highlights the critical role of community engagement and local leadership in the success of the community-wide screening. The planning and implementation process incorporated culturally grounded strategies to promote trust, reduce stigma, and enhance participation. Clinic delivery was shaped by coordinated interagency efforts and informed by previous screening initiatives in the territory.\nBy combining epidemiological findings with high-level insights into operational planning and community engagement, this evaluation provides practical evidence to guide future TB control efforts in remote and high-incidence settings—while respecting the local context and the principles of cultural safety.\n\n\n\nThis research advances understanding of how community-wide screening can serve as an effective and context-sensitive strategy for TB control in remote Arctic communities.

    "title": "Why I Work in HIV and STBBIs - Ayel L. R. Batac",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Why I Work in HIV and STBBIs: A Personal and Professional Journey\nMay 7, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhen I began studying molecular biology as an undergraduate, I carried with me a deep sense of purpose. Like many students entering the life sciences, I was driven by a dream — to one day help cure cancer. I believed that if I could just understand disease at its most fundamental level, I could be part of the solution to one of the world’s greatest medical challenges.\nWhat captivated me most was the human body itself — its elegance, its complexity. Even in a state of health, it felt like an intricate puzzle. But the moment pathology entered the picture, that complexity multiplied. I remember thinking how difficult it was to grasp the body’s inner workings even when nothing was wrong — how much more difficult, then, when disease was involved. That realization gave me a new kind of respect for the scientific process, and also, quietly, a sense of doubt.\nAs I progressed in my studies, that doubt grew. Despite decades of research and extraordinary investment, cancer remains without a cure. The more I learned, the more I understood that science — as powerful and beautiful as it is — doesn’t always move at the pace of our hopes. I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.\nFortunately, I had the chance to step outside the lab and explore something new.\nI began working as a research assistant at the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, contributing to studies in population health, allergy, and clinical immunology. It was there that I got my first glimpse into the world of public health — and it shifted everything. I saw how public health wasn’t just about understanding disease, but about preventing it, supporting communities, and creating conditions where people could thrive. It wasn’t abstract. It was immediate, and it was deeply human.\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.\nI was given the opportunity to work as an infectious disease epidemiologist for the Government of Manitoba. In that role, I collaborated with epidemiologists, public health advisors, laboratory scientists, and medical officers of health. Together, we faced an unfolding crisis, with decisions needing to be made in real time. The work was urgent, collaborative, and fast-paced — and for the first time, I felt like I had found where I belonged.\nUnlike non-communicable diseases, which often require slow, long-term strategies, infectious diseases demand immediate action. They require basic science, clinical insight, and social understanding to come together — and that balance resonated with me. The field touched everything I cared about: biology, policy, data, and, most of all, people.\nAfter my experience with COVID-19, my attention turned to another crisis — one that had been ongoing for decades, but still demanded far more action: HIV and sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs).\nFrom my molecular biology background, I knew how formidable HIV is as a virus. Its ability to mutate — thanks to its error-prone reverse transcriptase — makes it extremely difficult to treat permanently or prevent with a long-lasting vaccine. A cure remains elusive. But I also knew that despite the scientific challenges, we already have the tools to control HIV. What’s missing, too often, is access, education, and equity.\nSo I made a quiet promise to myself:\nIf I can’t cure HIV, then I will help contain it.\nThis work became even more personal to me when I reflected on where I came from. Growing up in an Asian community, I saw how sexual health was often considered shameful — something not to be talked about, let alone prioritized. In the Philippines, where I have deep ties, HIV incidence has been rising, especially among young people and men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite progress in many parts of the world, stigma continues to be one of the greatest barriers to prevention and care in Southeast Asia.\nBut the issue isn’t just cultural — it’s systemic.\nI think about the individuals who are afraid to get tested, not because they lack information, but because they fear judgment. I think about the communities that are left behind, blamed, or ignored. And I think about those who are forced to make unimaginable choices simply to survive.\nWhen I was just seven years old, I already knew of children my age who were selling sex. Not out of choice, but out of desperation — to afford school, to put food on the table, to care for their families. That reality has stayed with me ever since. It planted something in me — a quiet fire that still burns.\nI dedicate my work to those children.\nTo those who had no childhood, no protection, and no choice. They deserved better, and they still do.\nNow, as a graduate student at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, I’ve found a path that allows me to combine my scientific training with advocacy, compassion, and community. Through my work in HIV and STBBIs, I aim to contribute to a world where public health is not only evidence-based, but people-centered.\nMy goal is not just to publish academic papers. I want to translate knowledge into impact — whether that’s through infographics that explain complex concepts, educational materials that reach underserved communities, or accessible writing like this blog. This site is a space where I share what I’m learning and working on, and where I hope others can learn, too.\nMost importantly, it’s a space to keep asking the questions that matter:\n\nHow do we reduce transmission — not just scientifically, but equitably?\nHow do we support people living with HIV — medically, emotionally, and socially?\nHow do we dismantle the stigma that continues to surround sexual health?\n\nPublic health is not value-free. It is shaped by politics, by power, and by systems — and that’s what makes it both complicated and necessary. I don’t have all the answers. But I know I want to be part of the effort to ask better questions, to listen more carefully, and to act more boldly.\nThank you for being here — and for caring about this work, too.\n-Ayel"

    "text": "PrEP 101: What It Is, Who It’s For, and What You Still Need to Know\nJune 17, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nPrEP — short for pre-exposure prophylaxis — powerfully prevents HIV when used properly. Yet many people still haven’t heard of it, don’t understand it, or aren’t sure if it’s for them. This blog breaks it down clearly, without stigma or confusion — just the facts and what they mean for you.\n\nWhat Is PrEP?\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a medication strategy for people who do not have HIV but are at risk of being exposed to it. The most common form involves taking a daily oral pill that contains two antiretroviral medications — tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine — which work by stopping the virus from making copies of itself if it enters the body.\nThink of it like a seatbelt for your immune system — it’s there just in case, providing critical protection when needed.\nThese tablets work by maintaining a steady level of medication in your bloodstream, so if the HIV virus enters the body, it encounters a hostile environment that prevents it from establishing an infection. Imagine PrEP like a security guard that stops the virus at the door.\nWhen taken consistently, daily PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by at least 74%. [CDC]\nPrEP is also available in an injectable form — long-acting cabotegravir — which is administered every two months. This medication works slightly differently: it’s an integrase inhibitor, preventing the virus from integrating into human DNA after exposure. Imagine it as a lock that keeps the virus from ever getting inside your body’s cells. Health Canada approved long-acting cabotegravir for PrEP in 2024 [CATIE].\nHowever, rollout is still limited. Availability varies across provinces and may depend on clinic access and prescribing practices.\nIf you live outside Canada, check with your local health authority, sexual health clinic, or HIV organization to learn how to access PrEP where you are.\n\n\nWho Should Consider PrEP?\nPrEP is recommended for anyone at ongoing risk of HIV. This includes:\n\nPeople with an HIV-positive partner (especially if their partner is not undetectable — remember U=U!)\nPeople who have condomless sex with new or multiple partners\nSex workers\nPeople who inject drugs\nPeople who share drug equipment\nPeople with a history of recent STBBIs\n\nIf you’re aware that your sexual practices involve potential risk, you deserve information and tools — not judgment. PrEP might be right for you.\n\n\nWhat PrEP Does (and Doesn’t) Do\nPrEP protects against HIV. It does not protect against other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs), such as:\n\nGonorrhea\nChlamydia\nSyphilis\nHerpes\nHepatitis B and C\nHPV (which can lead to cervical, anal, and throat cancers)\n\nThese infections are serious, too. Untreated STBBIs can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain, liver disease, neurological issues, and certain types of cancer — particularly cervical cancer linked to HPV.\nCondoms remain essential. They help prevent many STBBIs and are an easy, effective way to protect your health and the health of your partners.\nSTBBI rates have continued to rise in Canada even with increased PrEP availability — underscoring the need for comprehensive sexual health strategies. [PHAC STBBI Surveillance]\nIf you’re outside of Canada, check with your local health department or NGO for testing and STBBI education resources.\n\n\nIs PrEP Safe?\nYes. PrEP is considered very safe for most people.\nCommon short-term side effects include mild nausea, headache, or fatigue — which usually go away within the first few weeks.\nSome people may experience changes in kidney function or bone density over time, but these effects are rare and usually reversible once PrEP is stopped. That’s why regular check-ups and lab tests are part of the process.\nIn Canada, for example, doctors typically order a few baseline tests before you start PrEP: - An HIV test - Liver and kidney function tests - Screening for hepatitis B (and sometimes C)\nOnce you begin, expect follow-ups every three months to ensure your health is on track, check for STBBIs, and renew your prescription.\nYou don’t need a referral to start. Your family doctor can help. If you feel uncomfortable asking in person, many clinics offer telehealth and mail-order PrEP services — helping reduce barriers caused by stigma or distance.\n\n\nHow to Access PrEP in Canada\nYou can start by speaking with your family doctor or visiting a sexual health clinic. Here’s a typical process:\n\nInitial visit: Discuss your sexual health and interest in PrEP.\nScreening: Your provider will test for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and check kidney and liver function.\nPrescription: If everything looks good, you’ll receive a prescription.\nOngoing follow-up: Expect to check in every 3 months for testing and renewal.\n\nYou can also access PrEP via community health clinics or online services in many provinces.\n\n\nIs PrEP Covered in Canada?\nYes — but coverage varies by province:\n\nBC, Alberta, Quebec, NWT, Yukon, and PEI: Publicly funded\nOntario and other provinces: Covered by private plans, Trillium Drug Program, or other supports\nCheck your province’s public health website or CATIE’s PrEP Access Guide for updates\n\nIf you’re outside of Canada, access and affordability will vary — but PrEP is included in WHO’s global HIV prevention guidelines.\n\n\nIntersectionality and PrEP\nPrEP isn’t just for one group. It’s a powerful tool for anyone — regardless of gender, identity, or background — who wants to protect their health.\nSexual health should be inclusive, equitable, and stigma-free. Whether you’re a cisgender gay man, a trans woman, a heterosexual individual, or someone who doesn’t fit into a box, you deserve options.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nPrEP is an empowering, evidence-based way to prevent HIV — and it’s one piece of a larger sexual health picture.\nIf you think PrEP might be right for you, talk to your doctor. Protecting your health isn’t about fear — it’s about facts, care, and choice.\nAnd remember: condoms, testing, communication, and compassion still matter.\nLearn more, ask questions, and take the steps that feel right for you.\nBecause your health — and your peace of mind — are worth it.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n– Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "U = U: The Science, the Message, and Why It Matters\nMay 23, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhat if one of the most powerful tools we have to stop HIV transmission is something most people have never even heard of?\nIt’s called U=U — short for Undetectable = Untransmittable — and it means that a person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and maintains an undetectable viral load cannot pass the virus to others through sex. Not “reduced risk.” Not “less likely.” Zero transmission.\nThis isn’t just a message of hope — it’s a message of science. And it has the power to change how we think about HIV, how we support those who live with it, and how we end stigma once and for all.\n\nWhat Does U=U Actually Mean?\nWhen someone living with HIV takes antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently, the amount of virus in their body drops to such low levels that it becomes undetectable on standard blood tests. The virus isn’t cured — but it is controlled.\nAnd here’s the most important part: when HIV is undetectable, it cannot be passed on sexually.\nThis is not a theory. It’s a fact, confirmed by some of the most significant research studies in HIV science:\n\n🧪 HPTN 052 Study (2011)\nThis groundbreaking clinical trial followed over 1,700 mostly heterosexual couples across multiple continents. One partner in each couple was HIV-positive. The study compared couples where the HIV-positive partner started treatment early with those who delayed treatment.\nOnly one linked transmission occurred in the early treatment group, and it happened shortly after therapy began. In contrast, 27 linked transmissions occurred in the delayed treatment group. This resulted in a 96% reduction in risk — one of the first and strongest proofs that ART can prevent transmission.\n\nRead the HPTN 052 Study Here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER Study (2016)\nThis European study followed 888 couples (340 gay male and 548 heterosexual) where one partner was HIV-positive and on effective ART. Over 1,238 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported tens of thousands of condomless sex acts.\nNo HIV transmissions occurred between partners. Of the 11 infections observed, genetic testing confirmed all came from outside the primary relationship. The takeaway? When someone is on ART and virally suppressed, they don’t transmit HIV — even without condoms.\n\nRead the PARTNER Study Here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER2 Study (2019)\nThis follow-up study focused exclusively on gay male couples — a group often considered at higher risk for HIV transmission. Over 1,593 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported about 76,088 acts of condomless anal sex while the HIV-positive partner had a suppressed viral load.\nAgain, no HIV transmissions occurred. This study confirmed what PARTNER1 had shown and extended it to even the highest-risk types of sex: U=U holds true, even during anal sex among MSM partners.\nThese three landmark studies give us what is rare in public health: definitive evidence. People living with HIV who are undetectable cannot transmit the virus through sex. Full stop.\n\nRead the PARTNER2 Study Here\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Message Matters\nImagine being in a relationship, taking your medication every day, and knowing — with confidence — that you cannot transmit HIV to the person you love. That’s the kind of peace and freedom U=U makes possible.\nBut for too long, HIV has been surrounded by fear, misunderstanding, and silence. Many people still hold outdated ideas — that HIV can be passed through hugging, sharing food, or being near someone living with the virus. These misconceptions are not just wrong; they isolate people and fuel stigma.\nU=U tells a different story. A story based in science. It reminds us that with access to treatment and care, people living with HIV can enjoy full, loving, and healthy lives. They can be intimate, have families, and move through the world without fear of harming others — because they can’t transmit the virus when undetectable.\nThis knowledge is not only medically important — it’s emotionally and socially liberating.\n\n\nFrom Science to Society: Where We Stand Now\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, U=U is still not widely communicated. In many parts of the world, healthcare workers may not mention it, patients may not be aware of it, and systems may not support the testing and treatment access needed to achieve undetectable status.\nStigma continues to be one of the biggest obstacles. Too many people living with HIV are still judged unfairly, discriminated against, or made to feel unsafe — even when they pose no risk to others.\nThis is why sharing U=U matters so deeply. It challenges fear with facts. It replaces shame with dignity. And it builds a foundation of trust — between people, partners, and health systems.\n\n\nU=U and the Bigger Picture of HIV Prevention\nU=U is a major breakthrough, but it’s part of a broader strategy for HIV prevention. Other essential tools include:\n\nRoutine HIV testing\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV-negative individuals\nCondoms and harm reduction programs\nSupportive, stigma-free care environments\n\nWhen these tools work together, they help create communities where HIV is no longer something to fear, but something we know how to manage — together.\n\n\nEquity and Access Still Matter\nIt’s important to acknowledge that not everyone has equal access to ART, viral load monitoring, or supportive healthcare. In many low- and middle-income countries — and even in marginalized communities within high-income ones — systemic barriers still limit what’s possible.\nThat’s why U=U must go hand-in-hand with efforts to ensure universal access to treatment, routine testing, and public education. This message is only as powerful as it is reachable.\nEveryone deserves the opportunity to be undetectable — and untransmittable.\n\n\nFeaturing the Message: U=U in One Glance\nTo support the points discussed above, the following infographic provides a clear and accessible summary of what U=U means and why it matters. It’s a helpful visual to reinforce key information and support understanding:\n\nThis image highlights several core takeaways:\n\nWhat “undetectable” means: With effective HIV treatment, the virus is suppressed so low it can’t be detected by standard tests — this is called having an undetectable viral load.\nWhat it means for prevention: A person with an undetectable viral load cannot pass HIV through sex. This is not just reassuring — it’s scientifically proven.\n\n\n\nWhy This Changes Everything\nSo what does this all mean for us, right now?\nThis message isn’t just about reducing risk — it’s about changing lives:\n\n✅ U=U reduces stigma by replacing fear with facts. When people know that those with undetectable HIV cannot transmit the virus, it chips away at the misinformation that fuels rejection and discrimination.\n✅ It encourages treatment and testing by showing that knowing your status and accessing ART has both personal and public benefits.\n✅ It builds trust in public health by demonstrating how scientific evidence can empower people, not just diagnose them.\n✅ It empowers people living with HIV to live openly, form relationships, and plan families — all without fear of transmission.\n\nBut while U=U addresses HIV prevention, it’s also important to remember:\n\n🛡️ PrEP protects only against HIV — not other STIs.\n\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a powerful tool that helps HIV-negative individuals stay HIV-negative. But it does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections. That means protection like condoms still plays a key role — especially when it comes to preventing infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis B or C.\n\n⚠️ U=U doesn’t prevent other STBBIs.\n\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and others can still be transmitted, even when HIV is undetectable. That’s why using condoms consistently and correctly remains essential. Condoms offer strong protection not only against HIV but also against a wide range of STIs and STBBIs.\nBy combining strategies like U=U, PrEP, and especially consistent condom use, individuals can build a well-rounded approach to sexual health that protects not only against HIV, but also against a wide range of other STBBIs — fostering both physical health and human dignity.\nBeing undetectable changes what’s possible — but a comprehensive approach to sexual health is what keeps everyone safe, healthy, and respected.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nLet’s be absolutely clear:\n\nA person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and has an undetectable viral load cannot transmit the virus sexually.\nThis truth is backed by science, supported by real-world evidence, and endorsed by leading global health organizations.\nU=U is a public health breakthrough — and a message of hope, equity, and human dignity.\n\nThe more we share this message, the more we break down stigma, build trust, and empower people — no matter their status.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"

    "title": "HIV Prevention Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Access",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect millions of people globally, with men who have sex with men (MSM) remaining disproportionately impacted. Biomedical innovations such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)—a daily or event-driven medication that can prevent HIV acquisition—have significantly expanded the toolkit for HIV prevention. When taken correctly, PrEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission by more than 90%.\nDespite its effectiveness, global uptake of PrEP remains uneven. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems often face severe resource constraints, access to PrEP is far from universal. MSM populations in these regions encounter additional layers of exclusion, including criminalization, stigma, discrimination, lack of culturally competent providers, and limited integration of HIV prevention into routine care.\nAccess challenges are particularly stark in rural areas, among younger MSM, and in settings where healthcare services are underdeveloped or poorly trusted. As a result, PrEP remains out of reach for many people who need it most—perpetuating avoidable infections and widening health inequities.\n\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers, policymakers, and community organisations are developing a range of non-clinic-based delivery models that bring HIV prevention services closer to the people who need them. These approaches decentralize PrEP delivery by moving it outside traditional healthcare settings and into community, digital, or pharmacy-based platforms that are more accessible, discreet, and community-embedded. They reflect a broader global shift toward differentiated service delivery and community-driven care that is often more accessible, less stigmatizing, and better suited to the realities of daily life for MSM in LMICs.\nExamples include:\n\nTelePrEP services that offer virtual consultations, remote prescriptions, and home delivery.**\nPharmacy-based PrEP access that empowers pharmacists to initiate and monitor PrEP use.**\nMobile outreach programs that reach MSM at bars, shelters, parks, and other informal venues.**\nmHealth tools that enable self-testing, automated reminders, digital counselling, and anonymous referrals.**\nPeer- and community-led delivery models that build on local trust and engagement.**\n\nThese approaches reduce dependency on overburdened clinic systems and actively challenge structural barriers to care. Decentralization not only expands reach—it also supports equity by meeting people where they are.\n\n\n\nOur current knowledge synthesis work investigates how decentralized PrEP delivery models are being implemented for MSM in LMICs. This work emerges at a time when global momentum is accelerating around PrEP expansion, differentiated service delivery, and digital health—particularly with a growing emphasis on key populations in HIV prevention strategies. While research on PrEP delivery models has grown, MSM in LMICs remain significantly underrepresented in both global syntheses and implementation evidence. This work helps to fill that gap by centring their experiences and the models designed to reach them.\nThis work seeks to:\n\nIdentify innovative and underreported models currently in use or under development\nExamine how these programs adapt to legal, cultural, infrastructural, and political constraints\nAnalyze key outcomes such as uptake, retention, user satisfaction, and provider engagement\nSurface lessons from community-led and task-shifted models, especially those reaching underserved MSM subgroups\nTranslate findings into insights that inform future programs, funding decisions, and national HIV strategies\n\n\n\n\nThis project highlights the importance of building health systems that respond to the lived realities of MSM, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments. We focus on delivery approaches that:\n\nCenter community knowledge and peer trust\nMinimize logistical, financial, and social barriers to prevention\nAddress the impact of surveillance, fear, and criminalization\nLeverage technology thoughtfully while considering digital divides\nPromote human dignity and user agency within HIV prevention systems\nEngage MSM communities in co-designing and adapting services that reflect local values, norms, and needs.\n\nBy understanding how decentralized models operate on the ground, this work contributes to more resilient, responsive, and equitable health systems—particularly for people pushed to the margins of care.\n\n\n\nThis work addresses one of the most pressing challenges in global HIV prevention: how to expand access to PrEP for populations consistently left behind by traditional health systems. Despite the proven effectiveness of PrEP, structural, social, and legal barriers continue to prevent MSM in low- and middle-income countries from benefiting equally.\nBy investigating decentralized, community-centred, and digitally enabled PrEP delivery models, this knowledge synthesis contributes to public health in several key ways:\n\nSupports evidence-informed innovation by identifying real-world models that extend beyond clinic walls and meet MSM where they are.\n\nElevates implementation strategies that promote equity, reduce stigma, and operate effectively in legally or socially hostile environments.\n\nProvides actionable insights for program implementers, NGOs, and policymakers seeking scalable, context-sensitive HIV prevention approaches.\n\nBridges the gap between research and practice by synthesizing diverse forms of knowledge—peer-reviewed evidence, grey literature, and community reports—to inform adaptable solutions.\n\nAdvances global health equity by centring the needs of MSM in LMICs, and reframing HIV prevention not just as access to medicine, but as access to dignity, autonomy, and safety.\n\nThis research aims to shift how we think about HIV prevention—not just in terms of medication and delivery, but in terms of systems design, trust-building, and community power. It contributes to the growing effort to align health equity, human rights, and universal access in the global response to HIV.\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon."

    "text": "To address these challenges, researchers, policymakers, and community organisations are developing a range of non-clinic-based delivery models that bring HIV prevention services closer to the people who need them. These approaches decentralize PrEP delivery by moving it outside traditional healthcare settings and into community, digital, or pharmacy-based platforms that are more accessible, discreet, and community-embedded. They reflect a broader global shift toward differentiated service delivery and community-driven care that is often more accessible, less stigmatizing, and better suited to the realities of daily life for MSM in LMICs.\nExamples include:\n\nTelePrEP services that offer virtual consultations, remote prescriptions, and home delivery.**\nPharmacy-based PrEP access that empowers pharmacists to initiate and monitor PrEP use.**\nMobile outreach programs that reach MSM at bars, shelters, parks, and other informal venues.**\nmHealth tools that enable self-testing, automated reminders, digital counselling, and anonymous referrals.**\nPeer- and community-led delivery models that build on local trust and engagement.**\n\nThese approaches reduce dependency on overburdened clinic systems and actively challenge structural barriers to care. Decentralization not only expands reach—it also supports equity by meeting people where they are."

    "title": "Let’s Talk About STBBIs - Ayel L. R. Batac",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s Talk About STBBIs: What They Are, Why They Matter, and What You Can Do\nMay 10, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nSexual health is a part of health — full stop. Yet even in 2025, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain heavily stigmatized, misunderstood, and under-discussed. And because we don’t talk about them enough, we allow misinformation, fear, and shame to take the place of facts, care, and prevention.\nThis blog post is my small way of changing that — by starting with the basics, and by sharing some of my own perspective.\n\nWhat Are STBBIs?\nSTBBIs — short for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections — are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. They can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, as well as through needle sharing, blood transfusions (where screening is limited), or from a birthing parent to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\nSome of the most common STBBIs include:\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)\nChlamydia\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\nHepatitis B and C\nHPV (Human Papillomavirus)\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2)\n\nEach of these infections is different — in symptoms, transmission, and treatment — but they share one thing in common: they’re all manageable, preventable, and in many cases, treatable.\n\n\nHow Common Are STBBIs?\nVery common — more common than most people think. According to the WHO, more than 1 million STIs are acquired every day worldwide. Many people living with STBBIs don’t even know they have one, because symptoms are often mild or absent. That’s why testing is so important.\nThe reality is: if you’re sexually active, you could be at risk — regardless of age, gender, relationship status, or sexual orientation.\n\n\nWhy Should We Care?\nSTBBIs don’t always cause symptoms right away. But left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences:\n\nInfertility\nChronic pain\nLiver disease and cancer (especially from hepatitis B and C)\nNeurological complications\nIncreased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV\n\nFor pregnant individuals, some STBBIs can lead to complications like miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital infections passed on to the baby.\nBut here’s the good news: Most STBBIs can be easily tested for, and many can be cured or effectively managed with treatment. Early detection truly makes all the difference.\n\n\nA Personal Perspective: Living Between Two Worlds\nAs someone who has lived in both a high-income country like Canada and a lower-middle-income country like the Philippines, I’ve seen firsthand the contrast in how sexual health is treated, taught, and accessed.\nIn Canada, I was fortunate to receive comprehensive sexual education in high school. We were taught about family planning methods like condoms and birth control pills, how to access them, and even how to use them properly. I still remember the condom demonstration using a model — a moment filled with nervous laughter from students, but also one that left a lasting impression. That education, awkward or not, was useful — and lifesaving.\nCanada’s public health system also provides access to free sexual health clinics, where youth — including young girls — can access contraceptives, STBBI testing, and counselling without stigma or barriers. We were taught how to test, why it matters to know our status, and how to protect ourselves through safer sex or abstinence.\nIn the Philippines, the contrast is stark. Sexual health remains a deeply taboo topic, especially in schools and within families. Comprehensive sexual education is rare, and public conversations around STBBIs are even rarer. Access to testing, treatment, and prevention tools like PrEP or even condoms can be limited — not just logistically, but culturally. The silence is loud, and the stigma can be overwhelming.\nThat contrast continues to fuel my commitment to public health. Because education should not be a luxury. Testing should not be a privilege. And silence should never be the barrier that keeps people from knowing their status and protecting themselves.\n\n\nWhat’s Holding Us Back?\nThe biggest barriers aren’t scientific — they’re social.\nMany people delay or avoid testing not because they lack access, but because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of what others might think. Fear of being associated with something “dirty” or “irresponsible.”\nThat stigma can be even more intense in communities where sex is rarely discussed openly. I’ve seen this play out personally — especially in Southeast Asian and religious contexts. But staying silent only allows the problem to grow.\nThe truth is, STBBIs don’t discriminate. They can affect anyone, regardless of how many partners you’ve had, how careful you are, or who you are. Risk isn’t about identity — it’s about biology and behavior, and more importantly, about access to information and care.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do: Take Care, Without Shame\nHere’s what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other:\n\nGet tested regularly. If you’re sexually active, routine testing is part of responsible healthcare — just like going to the dentist or getting a physical.\nUse protection. Condoms and dental dams help prevent many STBBIs. They’re not perfect, but they’re effective.\nKnow your options. Vaccines exist for HPV and hepatitis B. HIV prevention tools like PrEP and PEP are life-changing for many.\nTalk about it. Honest conversations with partners — and within our communities — can break down stigma and build trust.\nGet informed. The more we understand, the less room there is for shame.\n\n\n\nA Final Word: Knowledge Is Power, and Silence Is a Risk We Can’t Afford\nTalking about STBBIs shouldn’t be controversial — it should be standard practice. These infections are common, treatable, and preventable. Yet every day, people are put at risk not because they lack protection, but because they lack information, access, and support.\nI’ve seen how the silence around sexual health can cause real harm. I’ve lived in systems that empower people to make informed choices — and systems that shame them into silence. And I can tell you this: when we stay quiet, we don’t keep people safe — we leave them behind.\nBut we can choose something different.\nWe can choose to create communities where talking about sexual health is a sign of care, not shame. We can choose to push for better education, stronger services, and a healthcare system that leaves no one out. We can choose to get tested, get informed, and speak up — not just for ourselves, but for those who can’t yet do so safely.\nBecause knowledge is more than power — it’s protection. It’s freedom. And it’s a form of love.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"
