    "text": "\\(~\\)\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) continue to represent a major global public health challenge. Despite increasing awareness, testing rates for infections such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia remain low worldwide, particularly among marginalized populations including men who have sex with men (MSM). Asymptomatic infections frequently go undiagnosed, delaying treatment and hindering effective prevention and control.\nIn many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), stigma, financial barriers, and limited access to culturally appropriate services contribute to low testing uptake. Structural exclusion and social marginalization often prevent MSM and other key populations from engaging with formal health systems, perpetuating inequalities in access to care.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward approach is a social innovation that links public health service delivery with prosocial behaviour. Within STBBI prevention and testing, it offers individuals free diagnostic services—such as testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia—and then invites them to support another person’s access to testing through voluntary contributions or messages of encouragement.\nThe approach is grounded in three key principles:\n\nAccess: Removing financial barriers to testing\n\nAltruism: Encouraging reciprocity and the act of giving back\n\nCommunity engagement: Strengthening shared responsibility for health and well-being\n\nUnlike traditional fee-for-service or centrally funded systems, the pay-it-forward approach promotes solidarity and empowerment within communities. It provides a practical model for improving access to essential services in settings where stigma, financial constraints, or mistrust of institutions restrict care.\n\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward approach represents more than a mechanism for service delivery; it redefines how communities participate in public health. When combined with community engagement, it creates enabling environments where testing becomes accessible, supportive, and responsive to stigma.\nCommunity engagement activities—including peer outreach, peer messaging, and local advocacy—help strengthen collective ownership of sexual health and reinforce trust between health systems and communities. Together, these efforts:\n\nEmpower individuals to take part in collective health promotion\n\nFoster trust and cooperation between communities and health services\n\nExpand the reach and uptake of STBBI testing, particularly in LMIC settings\n\n\n\n\nMy current research evaluates the effectiveness and implementation of the pay-it-forward approach among MSM in China through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Key areas of focus include:\n\nUptake of STBBI testing across different behavioural intervention arms\n\nProsocial behaviours as indicators of community engagement and reciprocity\n\nClinic-level and demographic determinants of testing outcomes\n\nAdaptation of a digital, self-sampling version of the pay-it-forward approach to enhance accessibility in low-resource contexts\n\nThis research contributes to the growing global evidence base on how social innovation and behavioural science can strengthen health systems, improve testing coverage, and address the needs of populations most affected by stigma and inequity.\n\n\n\nThe research applies a mixed-methods design to capture both impact and implementation outcomes:\n\nQuantitative analysis: Randomized controlled trials assess behavioural and clinical outcomes, including testing uptake and donation patterns.\n\nQualitative inquiry: In-depth interviews with participants and providers explore motivations, perceived barriers, and emotional responses.\n\nProcess evaluation: Implementation fidelity, feasibility, and scalability are assessed under real-world conditions.\n\nThis comprehensive approach supports both rigorous evidence generation and context-sensitive insights that inform adaptation and scale-up.\n\n\n\nThe pay-it-forward approach demonstrates how social innovation can advance equity, inclusion, and sustainability within public health systems. Evidence from ongoing research highlights its potential to:\n\nExpand access to essential health services through community-driven and decentralized financing models\n\nPromote stigma-sensitive and culturally responsive testing practices tailored to the experiences of MSM and other key populations\n\nStrengthen the interface between health systems and communities by embedding social innovation within service delivery\n\nContribute to global efforts toward universal health coverage and equitable access to sexual and reproductive health services\n\nBy framing STBBI testing as a collective act of care, the pay-it-forward approach aligns with broader global health goals to build inclusive, resilient, and people-centred systems for sexual health and well-being.\n\\(~\\)\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon."

    "text": "\\(~\\)\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern in remote Arctic communities across Canada, where incidence rates are consistently the highest in the country. Despite long-standing efforts to control and eliminate the disease, TB continues to re-emerge in the form of outbreaks, particularly in geographically isolated settings where social and structural challenges persist.\nIn these contexts, barriers such as limited access to healthcare, overcrowded housing, and long-standing distrust in public health systems undermine prevention and control efforts. These challenges are often compounded by logistical obstacles—such as seasonal mobility, infrastructure limitations, and staff turnover—that constrain timely diagnosis and treatment.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nOne of the most promising interventions to disrupt TB transmission in high-burden regions is community-wide screening. This approach involves proactively offering screening to all members of a community—regardless of symptoms—to detect both latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.\nThe benefits of community-wide screening include:\n\nReducing time to diagnosis, thereby interrupting transmission chains\n\nIdentifying latent infections before they progress to active disease\n\nProviding culturally adapted outreach and education to increase participation\n\nStrengthening community trust through local leadership and engagement\n\nPrevious implementations of community-wide screening in Nunavut, Canada, have demonstrated both effectiveness and cost-efficiency when adapted to local realities. When combined with targeted health promotion and community-driven planning, these initiatives support early detection, treatment uptake, and long-term disease control.\n\n\n\nMy current work focuses on the evaluation of a community-wide screening clinic conducted in response to a TB outbreak in Nunavut. This evaluation examines how the initiative:\n\nDetected and treated both active and latent TB cases\n\nPromoted awareness and reduced stigma through bilingual outreach\n\nAddressed barriers to participation and treatment completion\n\nApplied lessons from previous community-wide screening efforts to strengthen delivery\n\nThis research contributes to operational knowledge on how community-based strategies can strengthen TB prevention and control in remote, high-incidence regions.\n\n\n\nThis evaluation takes a quantitative, epidemiological approach to assess the outcomes of a community-wide screening initiative conducted in response to a TB outbreak in Nunavut. Program data were analyzed to examine screening coverage, diagnostic outcomes, and treatment initiation for both active TB and LTBI.\nThe study also highlights the critical role of community engagement and local leadership in the success of the community-wide screening. The planning and implementation process incorporated culturally grounded strategies to promote trust, reduce stigma, and enhance participation. Clinic delivery was shaped by coordinated interagency efforts and informed by previous screening initiatives in the territory.\nBy combining epidemiological findings with high-level insights into operational planning and community engagement, this evaluation provides practical evidence to guide future TB control efforts in remote and high-incidence settings—while respecting the local context and the principles of cultural safety.\n\n\n\nThis research advances understanding of how community-wide screening can serve as an effective and context-sensitive strategy for TB control in remote Arctic communities. Key contributions include:\n\nProviding real-world evidence on the epidemiological impact of community-wide screening in a high-incidence, underserved setting\n\nHighlighting the role of community engagement in increasing screening uptake and reducing barriers to participation\n\nDemonstrating how operational planning, when informed by local knowledge and interagency collaboration, can enhance intervention effectiveness\n\nInforming future TB response strategies that centre cultural safety, community leadership, and adaptability to local realities\n\nBy emphasising trust, collaboration, and responsiveness to community needs, this work supports the broader vision of TB elimination in Nunavut and contributes to national public health goals rooted in equity and reconciliation.\n\\(~\\)\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon.\n\\(~\\)\n This research is conducted in collaboration with the Government of Nunavut, reflecting a shared commitment to advancing community-led and culturally grounded approaches to tuberculosis prevention and control in northern Canada."

    "text": "PrEP 101: What It Is, Who It’s For, and What You Still Need to Know\nJune 17, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nPrEP — short for pre-exposure prophylaxis — powerfully prevents HIV when used properly. Yet many people still haven’t heard of it, don’t understand it, or aren’t sure if it’s for them. This blog breaks it down clearly, without stigma or confusion — just the facts and what they mean for you.\n\nWhat Is PrEP?\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a medication strategy for people who do not have HIV but are at risk of being exposed to it. The most common form involves taking a daily oral pill that contains two antiretroviral medications — tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine — which work by stopping the virus from making copies of itself if it enters the body.\nThink of it like a seatbelt for your immune system — it’s there just in case, providing critical protection when needed.\nThese tablets work by maintaining a steady level of medication in your bloodstream, so if the HIV virus enters the body, it encounters a hostile environment that prevents it from establishing an infection. Imagine PrEP like a security guard that stops the virus at the door.\nWhen taken consistently, daily PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by at least 74%. [CDC]\nPrEP is also available in an injectable form — long-acting cabotegravir — which is administered every two months. This medication works slightly differently: it’s an integrase inhibitor, preventing the virus from integrating into human DNA after exposure. Imagine it as a lock that keeps the virus from ever getting inside your body’s cells. Health Canada approved long-acting cabotegravir for PrEP in 2024 [CATIE].\nHowever, rollout is still limited. Availability varies across provinces and may depend on clinic access and prescribing practices.\nIf you live outside Canada, check with your local health authority, sexual health clinic, or HIV organization to learn how to access PrEP where you are.\n\n\nWho Should Consider PrEP?\nPrEP is recommended for anyone at ongoing risk of HIV. This includes:\n\nPeople with an HIV-positive partner (especially if their partner is not undetectable — remember U=U!)\nPeople who have condomless sex with new or multiple partners\nSex workers\nPeople who inject drugs\nPeople who share drug equipment\nPeople with a history of recent STBBIs\n\nIf you’re aware that your sexual practices involve potential risk, you deserve information and tools — not judgment. PrEP might be right for you.\n\n\nWhat PrEP Does (and Doesn’t) Do\nPrEP protects against HIV. It does not protect against other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs), such as:\n\nGonorrhea\nChlamydia\nSyphilis\nHerpes\nHepatitis B and C\nHPV (which can lead to cervical, anal, and throat cancers)\n\nThese infections are serious, too. Untreated STBBIs can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain, liver disease, neurological issues, and certain types of cancer — particularly cervical cancer linked to HPV.\nCondoms remain essential. They help prevent many STBBIs and are an easy, effective way to protect your health and the health of your partners.\nSTBBI rates have continued to rise in Canada even with increased PrEP availability — underscoring the need for comprehensive sexual health strategies. [PHAC STBBI Surveillance]\nIf you’re outside of Canada, check with your local health department or NGO for testing and STBBI education resources.\n\n\nIs PrEP Safe?\nYes. PrEP is considered very safe for most people.\nCommon short-term side effects include mild nausea, headache, or fatigue — which usually go away within the first few weeks.\nSome people may experience changes in kidney function or bone density over time, but these effects are rare and usually reversible once PrEP is stopped. That’s why regular check-ups and lab tests are part of the process.\nIn Canada, for example, doctors typically order a few baseline tests before you start PrEP: - An HIV test - Liver and kidney function tests - Screening for hepatitis B (and sometimes C)\nOnce you begin, expect follow-ups every three months to ensure your health is on track, check for STBBIs, and renew your prescription.\nYou don’t need a referral to start. Your family doctor can help. If you feel uncomfortable asking in person, many clinics offer telehealth and mail-order PrEP services — helping reduce barriers caused by stigma or distance.\n\n\nHow to Access PrEP in Canada\nYou can start by speaking with your family doctor or visiting a sexual health clinic. Here’s a typical process:\n\nInitial visit: Discuss your sexual health and interest in PrEP.\nScreening: Your provider will test for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and check kidney and liver function.\nPrescription: If everything looks good, you’ll receive a prescription.\nOngoing follow-up: Expect to check in every 3 months for testing and renewal.\n\nYou can also access PrEP via community health clinics or online services in many provinces.\n\n\nIs PrEP Covered in Canada?\nYes — but coverage varies by province:\n\nBC, Alberta, Quebec, NWT, Yukon, and PEI: Publicly funded\nOntario and other provinces: Covered by private plans, Trillium Drug Program, or other supports\nCheck your province’s public health website or CATIE’s PrEP Access Guide for updates\n\nIf you’re outside of Canada, access and affordability will vary — but PrEP is included in WHO’s global HIV prevention guidelines.\n\n\nIntersectionality and PrEP\nPrEP isn’t just for one group. It’s a powerful tool for anyone — regardless of gender, identity, or background — who wants to protect their health.\nSexual health should be inclusive, equitable, and stigma-free. Whether you’re a cisgender gay man, a trans woman, a heterosexual individual, or someone who doesn’t fit into a box, you deserve options.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nPrEP is an empowering, evidence-based way to prevent HIV — and it’s one piece of a larger sexual health picture.\nIf you think PrEP might be right for you, talk to your doctor. Protecting your health isn’t about fear — it’s about facts, care, and choice.\nAnd remember: condoms, testing, communication, and compassion still matter.\nLearn more, ask questions, and take the steps that feel right for you.\nBecause your health — and your peace of mind — are worth it.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n– Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why I Work in HIV and STBBIs: A Personal and Professional Journey\nMay 7, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhen I began studying molecular biology as an undergraduate, I carried with me a deep sense of purpose. Like many students entering the life sciences, I was driven by a dream — to one day help cure cancer. I believed that if I could just understand disease at its most fundamental level, I could be part of the solution to one of the world’s greatest medical challenges.\nWhat captivated me most was the human body itself — its elegance, its complexity. Even in a state of health, it felt like an intricate puzzle. But the moment pathology entered the picture, that complexity multiplied. I remember thinking how difficult it was to grasp the body’s inner workings even when nothing was wrong — how much more difficult, then, when disease was involved. That realization gave me a new kind of respect for the scientific process, and also, quietly, a sense of doubt.\nAs I progressed in my studies, that doubt grew. Despite decades of research and extraordinary investment, cancer remains without a cure. The more I learned, the more I understood that science — as powerful and beautiful as it is — doesn’t always move at the pace of our hopes. I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.\nFortunately, I had the chance to step outside the lab and explore something new.\nI began working as a research assistant at the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, contributing to studies in population health, allergy, and clinical immunology. It was there that I got my first glimpse into the world of public health — and it shifted everything. I saw how public health wasn’t just about understanding disease, but about preventing it, supporting communities, and creating conditions where people could thrive. It wasn’t abstract. It was immediate, and it was deeply human.\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.\nI was given the opportunity to work as an infectious disease epidemiologist for the Government of Manitoba. In that role, I collaborated with epidemiologists, public health advisors, laboratory scientists, and medical officers of health. Together, we faced an unfolding crisis, with decisions needing to be made in real time. The work was urgent, collaborative, and fast-paced — and for the first time, I felt like I had found where I belonged.\nUnlike non-communicable diseases, which often require slow, long-term strategies, infectious diseases demand immediate action. They require basic science, clinical insight, and social understanding to come together — and that balance resonated with me. The field touched everything I cared about: biology, policy, data, and, most of all, people.\nAfter my experience with COVID-19, my attention turned to another crisis — one that had been ongoing for decades, but still demanded far more action: HIV and sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs).\nFrom my molecular biology background, I knew how formidable HIV is as a virus. Its ability to mutate — thanks to its error-prone reverse transcriptase — makes it extremely difficult to treat permanently or prevent with a long-lasting vaccine. A cure remains elusive. But I also knew that despite the scientific challenges, we already have the tools to control HIV. What’s missing, too often, is access, education, and equity.\nSo I made a quiet promise to myself:\nIf I can’t cure HIV, then I will help contain it.\nThis work became even more personal to me when I reflected on where I came from. Growing up in an Asian community, I saw how sexual health was often considered shameful — something not to be talked about, let alone prioritized. In the Philippines, where I have deep ties, HIV incidence has been rising, especially among young people and men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite progress in many parts of the world, stigma continues to be one of the greatest barriers to prevention and care in Southeast Asia.\nBut the issue isn’t just cultural — it’s systemic.\nI think about the individuals who are afraid to get tested, not because they lack information, but because they fear judgment. I think about the communities that are left behind, blamed, or ignored. And I think about those who are forced to make unimaginable choices simply to survive.\nWhen I was just seven years old, I already knew of children my age who were selling sex. Not out of choice, but out of desperation — to afford school, to put food on the table, to care for their families. That reality has stayed with me ever since. It planted something in me — a quiet fire that still burns.\nI dedicate my work to those children.\nTo those who had no childhood, no protection, and no choice. They deserved better, and they still do.\nNow, as a graduate student at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, I’ve found a path that allows me to combine my scientific training with advocacy, compassion, and community. Through my work in HIV and STBBIs, I aim to contribute to a world where public health is not only evidence-based, but people-centered.\nMy goal is not just to publish academic papers. I want to translate knowledge into impact — whether that’s through infographics that explain complex concepts, educational materials that reach underserved communities, or accessible writing like this blog. This site is a space where I share what I’m learning and working on, and where I hope others can learn, too.\nMost importantly, it’s a space to keep asking the questions that matter:\n\nHow do we reduce transmission — not just scientifically, but equitably?\nHow do we support people living with HIV — medically, emotionally, and socially?\nHow do we dismantle the stigma that continues to surround sexual health?\n\nPublic health is not value-free. It is shaped by politics, by power, and by systems — and that’s what makes it both complicated and necessary. I don’t have all the answers. But I know I want to be part of the effort to ask better questions, to listen more carefully, and to act more boldly.\nThank you for being here — and for caring about this work, too.\n-Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Syphilis Self-Testing: Access Is the Intervention\nJanuary 2, 2026\n\n TL;DR \n\n\nSyphilis is treatable, yet cases continue to rise.\n\n\nThe problem is not treatment. It’s access to timely testing.\n\n\nCentralized diagnostic systems work well for many, but still miss people at highest risk.\n\n\nDecentralized approaches, including syphilis self-testing, have expanded access in many global settings.\n\n\nSelf-testing is not a replacement for healthcare, but a powerful entry point into care when designed with equity in mind.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when a health system is designed to work well, but not for everyone?\nI have lived in both Southeast Asia and North America, and have experienced health systems that approach access and diagnostics in very different ways. Growing up across these two contexts shaped how I understand health, access, and who systems are really built for, long before I had the language of public health to describe it.\nThe contrast between these settings is striking. In many countries in Southeast Asia, access to healthcare often depends on proximity, cost, and community. In Canada and the United States, healthcare is more structured and centralized, accessed through clinics, hospitals, and laboratories. Over time, and through training and experience in public health, these differences became clearer, especially in how diagnostic systems influence who is reached and who is missed.\nThat perspective has stayed with me, and it shaped a recent invited commentary I co-authored with colleagues in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.\nI was fortunate to work on this commentary with colleagues who are global leaders in diagnostics and infectious disease research: Dr. Michael Marks, Dr. Joseph Tucker, and Dr. Rosanna Peeling. Their work has helped shape how we think about diagnostics, self-testing, and health system design across diverse settings.\nAt the heart of our commentary is a deceptively simple question:\n\nIf syphilis is treatable, why are cases still rising, and who is being missed by the way we test?\n\n\nCentralized Diagnostics: Strengths and Limits\nIn Canada, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) testing relies heavily on a centralized diagnostic model. Most testing occurs in labs and hospitals. Specimens are sent to central laboratories, confirmatory testing follows established algorithms, and results are reviewed by clinicians who can initiate treatment and arrange follow-up care.\nThis system has real strengths. Centralized diagnostics support high-quality laboratory confirmation, clinical oversight, and strong linkage to care. For many people, this model works well.\nBut it also assumes something that is not always true. It assumes people can and will engage with clinic-based care.\nAcross Canada, STBBIs have increased steadily over the past decade, including ongoing rises in syphilis. These trends have drawn attention to longstanding challenges in ensuring timely access to testing, follow-up, and prevention services.\nCentralized systems can contribute to delayed diagnoses, uneven geographic access, and limited surge capacity during outbreaks. For individuals facing stigma, geographic isolation, limited mobility, housing precarity, or mistrust in healthcare systems, laboratory-based testing can be difficult to access or avoided altogether. The result is fewer opportunities for testing, longer intervals between infection and diagnosis, and reduced effectiveness of surveillance and outbreak response.\nOver time, I have come to see that these are not failures of individuals, but failures of design. A system can be technically strong and still miss those at highest risk.\n\n\nWhat Decentralized Diagnostics Have Shown Us\nIn many parts of Asia and Africa, decentralized diagnostic strategies have emerged not as a convenience, but as a necessity. Rapid self-tests for STBBIs are common across much of Asia not because prevalence is higher, but because these tools fit the region’s public health realities.\nSeveral practical reasons explain their widespread use.\n\n1. Large populations and limited laboratory access\nMany countries across Asia serve very large and diverse populations, including rural and remote communities where access to full laboratory infrastructure is limited. Rapid tests do not require advanced equipment, can be used in small clinics or outreach settings, and deliver results within minutes rather than days.\n2. A public health focus on “test and treat”\nRapid tests support same-day diagnosis and treatment. This is critical where patients may not return for follow-up visits, where travel costs and time off work are real barriers, and where delays increase the risk of onward transmission.\n3. Cost and scalability\nCompared to laboratory-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture testing, rapid tests are generally cheaper per patient, easier to distribute at scale, and less dependent on highly trained laboratory personnel.\n4. Integration into existing programs\nRapid self-tests for STBBI are often bundled with HIV self-testing, antenatal care, and services for sex workers, migrants, and other key populations to prevent congenital syphilis and reduce HIV transmission.\n5. Stigma and discretion\nIn some settings, STBBI-related stigma discourages clinic visits. Rapid self-tests help by enabling fast, private testing, reducing the need for multiple visits, and supporting outreach-based or anonymous testing models.\n\nThere is an important nuance here. Rapid tests trade some diagnostic precision for access. They are excellent tools for screening, but reactive results often require confirmatory laboratory testing. This is not a sign of lower standards, but of context-appropriate medicine that prioritizes reach, timeliness, and public health impact.\nThis is something I see clearly through my work in China.\nMultiple randomized controlled trials in China have demonstrated the promise of syphilis self-testing, particularly when integrated with HIV testing. One pragmatic trial among men who have sex with men evaluated the secondary distribution of dual HIV and syphilis self-testing kits within social networks. Compared with site-based testing, participants who received self-testing kits tested more frequently and were more likely to motivate others in their networks to test. Importantly, individuals with reactive self-test results accessed laboratory-based confirmatory testing, and no adverse events were reported, including no evidence of social harm, coercion, or negative impacts on mental health.\n\nRead the China Study here\n\nSimilar evidence comes from Zimbabwe. A randomized controlled trial comparing facility-based syphilis testing with community-based self-testing among gay, bisexual, and transgender men found higher uptake in the self-testing arm, along with lower costs per test. While barriers remained, bringing testing into communities increased uptake and reduced costs for users.\n\nRead the Zimbabwe Study here\n\nAcross settings, decentralized approaches have expanded diagnostic reach, shortened the time from testing to results, reduced pressure on central laboratories, and improved responsiveness during outbreaks. Most importantly, they have reached people who were not being reached before.\n\nFor me, this reinforces a simple truth: how we design testing systems determines who gets counted, and who gets care.\n\n\n\nWhere Syphilis Self-Testing Fits In\nSyphilis self-testing allows individuals to test themselves, typically using a finger-prick blood sample, outside of a clinic setting and receive results within minutes.\nRecently, the first over-the-counter syphilis self-test was authorized in the United States. This represents a meaningful shift in how we think about STBBI diagnostics, particularly in high-income countries that have long relied almost exclusively on centralized laboratory models.\nEvidence from multiple countries shows that syphilis self-tests are accurate, usable, and acceptable. Many users are first-time testers, meaning people who had not previously accessed clinic-based testing at all.\nThat alone makes syphilis self-testing worth paying attention to.\n\n\nSelf-Testing as an Entry Point to Care\nSyphilis self-testing is not a stand-alone solution.\nCurrent self-tests detect treponemal antibodies, which can remain positive for life. Reactive results always require confirmatory laboratory testing. Clear instructions and strong linkage to care are essential to avoid confusion or harm.\nWhen positioned correctly, self-testing can function as a powerful entry point into care, particularly for people who are underserved by centralized systems.\nExperience with HIV self-testing offers a clear lesson. Impact depends not only on the test itself, but on the system around it. Community distribution, user support, referral pathways, and public investment are what turn diagnostics into effective public health tools.\nSyphilis self-testing must follow the same principle.\n\n\nDesigning for Equity\nSelf-testing is not automatically equitable.\nIf syphilis self-tests are only available online, in pharmacies, or at a cost, they risk excluding people without internet access, stable housing, or disposable income. If linkage to care is not embedded, individuals may be left with results but no support.\nFrom my perspective, shaped by lived experience and global public health work, the goal should not be to choose between centralized or decentralized diagnostics. The goal should be to combine their strengths.\nWe need systems that preserve strong linkage to care while also meeting people where they are.\n\n What This Means in Practice \n\n\nFor policymakers: invest in hybrid diagnostic models that combine accessibility with strong linkage to care.\n\n\nFor clinicians and public health practitioners: view self-testing as an entry point, not a threat to care.\n\n\nFor communities and advocates: push for testing options that reflect how people actually live, move, and seek care.\n\n\nFor all of us: question who is being missed when systems are designed for convenience rather than equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nSyphilis self-testing is not a silver bullet, but it is a meaningful intervention.\nUsed thoughtfully, it can expand access, normalize testing, activate social networks, and help reach people who are currently being missed, even in countries with well-established healthcare systems.\nAccess without equity is not access.\nTesting that works for some, but not for all, is not enough.\nThank you for being here.\nLet’s keep talking.\n-Ayel\n\\(~\\)\n\n\\(~\\)\n\nRead the Commentary\nThe full commentary is available in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology (Editor’s Pick).\n\nRead the full commentary here\n\n\nCommentary Authors\nThis commentary was written by a team of researchers whose work spans diagnostics, infectious diseases, and global public health, with a shared focus on access, equity, and real-world impact.\nI am Ayel L.

    "section": "",
    "text": "U = U: The Science, the Message, and Why It Matters\nMay 23, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhat if one of the most powerful tools we have to stop HIV transmission is something most people have never even heard of?\nIt’s called U = U — short for Undetectable = Untransmittable — and it means that a person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and maintains an undetectable viral load cannot pass the virus to others through sex. Not “reduced risk”. Not “less likely”. Zero transmission.\nThis isn’t just a message of hope. It’s a message of science. And it has the power to change how we think about HIV, how we support those who live with it, and how we end stigma once and for all.\n\nWhat Does U = U Actually Mean?\nWhen someone living with HIV takes antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently, the amount of virus in their body drops to such low levels that it becomes undetectable on standard blood tests. The virus isn’t cured — but it is controlled.\nAnd here’s the most important part: when HIV is undetectable, it cannot be passed on sexually.\nThis is not a theory. It’s a fact, confirmed by some of the most significant research studies in HIV science:\n\n🧪 HPTN 052 Study (2011)\nThis groundbreaking clinical trial followed over 1,700 mostly heterosexual couples across multiple continents. One partner in each couple was HIV-positive. The study compared couples where the HIV-positive partner started treatment early with those who delayed treatment.\nOnly one linked transmission occurred in the early treatment group, and it happened shortly after therapy began. In contrast, 27 linked transmissions occurred in the delayed treatment group. This resulted in a 96% reduction in risk — one of the first and strongest proofs that ART can prevent transmission.\n\nRead the HPTN 052 Study here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER Study (2016)\nThis European study followed 888 couples (340 gay male and 548 heterosexual) where one partner was HIV-positive and on effective ART. Over 1,238 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported tens of thousands of condomless sex acts.\nNo HIV transmissions occurred between partners. Of the 11 infections observed, genetic testing confirmed all came from outside the primary relationship. The takeaway? When someone is on ART and virally suppressed, they don’t transmit HIV — even without condoms.\n\nRead the PARTNER Study here\n\n\n\n🧪 PARTNER2 Study (2019)\nThis follow-up study focused exclusively on gay male couples — a group often considered at higher risk for HIV transmission. Over 1,593 couple-years of follow-up, participants reported about 76,088 acts of condomless anal sex while the HIV-positive partner had a suppressed viral load.\nAgain, no HIV transmissions occurred. This study confirmed what PARTNER1 had shown and extended it to even the highest-risk types of sex: U = U holds true, even during anal sex among MSM partners.\nThese three landmark studies give us what is rare in public health: definitive evidence. People living with HIV who are undetectable cannot transmit the virus through sex. Full stop.\n\nRead the PARTNER2 Study here\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Message Matters\nImagine being in a relationship, taking your medication every day, and knowing, with confidence, that you cannot transmit HIV to the person you love. That’s the kind of peace and freedom U = U makes possible.\nBut for too long, HIV has been surrounded by fear, misunderstanding, and silence. Many people still hold outdated ideas — that HIV can be passed through hugging, sharing food, or being near someone living with the virus. These misconceptions are not just wrong; they isolate people and fuel stigma.\nU = U tells a different story. A story based in science. It reminds us that with access to treatment and care, people living with HIV can enjoy full, loving, and healthy lives. They can be intimate, have families, and move through the world without fear of harming others, because they can’t transmit the virus when undetectable.\nThis knowledge is not only medically important — it’s emotionally and socially liberating.\n\n\nFrom Science to Society: Where We Stand Now\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, U = U is still not widely communicated. In many parts of the world, healthcare workers may not mention it, patients may not be aware of it, and systems may not support the testing and treatment access needed to achieve undetectable status.\nStigma continues to be one of the biggest obstacles. Too many people living with HIV are still judged unfairly, discriminated against, or made to feel unsafe — even when they pose no risk to others.\nThis is why sharing U = U matters so deeply. It challenges fear with facts. It replaces shame with dignity. And it builds a foundation of trust — between people, partners, and health systems.\n\n\nU = U and the Bigger Picture of HIV Prevention\nU = U is a major breakthrough, but it’s part of a broader strategy for HIV prevention. Other essential tools include:\n\nRoutine HIV testing\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV-negative individuals\nCondoms and harm reduction programs\nSupportive, stigma-free care environments\n\nWhen these tools work together, they help create communities where HIV is no longer something to fear, but something we know how to manage — together.\n\n\nEquity and Access Still Matter\nIt’s important to acknowledge that not everyone has equal access to ART, viral load monitoring, or supportive healthcare. In many low- and middle-income countries, and even in marginalized communities within high-income ones — systemic barriers still limit what’s possible.\nThat’s why U = U must go hand-in-hand with efforts to ensure universal access to treatment, routine testing, and public education. This message is only as powerful as it is reachable.\nEveryone deserves the opportunity to be undetectable — and untransmittable.\n\n\nFeaturing the Message: U = U in One Glance\nTo support the points discussed above, the following infographic provides a clear and accessible summary of what U = U means and why it matters. It’s a helpful visual to reinforce key information and support understanding:\n\nThis image highlights several core takeaways:\n\nWhat “undetectable” means: With effective HIV treatment, the virus is suppressed so low it can’t be detected by standard tests — this is called having an undetectable viral load.\nWhat it means for prevention: A person with an undetectable viral load cannot pass HIV through sex. This is not just reassuring — it’s scientifically proven.\n\n\n\nWhy This Changes Everything\nSo what does this all mean for us, right now?\nThis message isn’t just about reducing risk — it’s about changing lives:\n\n✅ U = U reduces stigma by replacing fear with facts. When people know that those with undetectable HIV cannot transmit the virus, it chips away at the misinformation that fuels rejection and discrimination.\n✅ It encourages treatment and testing by showing that knowing your status and accessing ART has both personal and public benefits.\n✅ It builds trust in public health by demonstrating how scientific evidence can empower people, not just diagnose them.\n✅ It empowers people living with HIV to live openly, form relationships, and plan families — all without fear of transmission.\n\nBut while U = U addresses HIV prevention, it’s also important to remember:\n\n🛡️ PrEP protects only against HIV — not other STIs.\n\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a powerful tool that helps HIV-negative individuals stay HIV-negative. But it does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections. That means protection like condoms still plays a key role — especially when it comes to preventing infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis B or C.\n\n⚠️ U = U doesn’t prevent other STBBIs.\n\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and others can still be transmitted, even when HIV is undetectable. That’s why using condoms consistently and correctly remains essential. Condoms offer strong protection not only against HIV but also against a wide range of STIs and STBBIs.\nBy combining strategies like U = U, PrEP, and especially consistent condom use, individuals can build a well-rounded approach to sexual health that protects not only against HIV, but also against a wide range of other STBBIs — fostering both physical health and human dignity.\nBeing undetectable changes what’s possible — but a comprehensive approach to sexual health is what keeps everyone safe, healthy, and respected.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nLet’s be absolutely clear:\n\nA person living with HIV who is on effective treatment and has an undetectable viral load cannot transmit the virus sexually.\nThis truth is backed by science, supported by real-world evidence, and endorsed by leading global health organizations.\nU = U is a public health breakthrough — and a message of hope, equity, and human dignity.\n\nThe more we share this message, the more we break down stigma, build trust, and empower people — no matter their status.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect millions of people globally, with men who have sex with men (MSM) remaining disproportionately impacted. Biomedical innovations such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)—a daily or event-driven medication that can prevent HIV acquisition—have significantly expanded the toolkit for HIV prevention. When taken correctly, PrEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission by more than 90%.\nDespite its effectiveness, global uptake of PrEP remains uneven. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems often face severe resource constraints, access to PrEP is far from universal. MSM populations in these regions encounter additional layers of exclusion, including criminalization, stigma, discrimination, lack of culturally competent providers, and limited integration of HIV prevention into routine care.\nAccess challenges are particularly stark in rural areas, among younger MSM, and in settings where healthcare services are underdeveloped or poorly trusted. As a result, PrEP remains out of reach for many people who need it most—perpetuating avoidable infections and widening health inequities.\n\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers, policymakers, and community organisations are developing a range of non-clinic-based delivery models that bring HIV prevention services closer to the people who need them. These approaches decentralize PrEP delivery by moving it outside traditional healthcare settings and into community, digital, or pharmacy-based platforms that are more accessible, discreet, and community-embedded. They reflect a broader global shift toward differentiated service delivery and community-driven care that is often more accessible, less stigmatizing, and better suited to the realities of daily life for MSM in LMICs.\nExamples include:\n\nTelePrEP services that offer virtual consultations, remote prescriptions, and home delivery.**\nPharmacy-based PrEP access that empowers pharmacists to initiate and monitor PrEP use.**\nMobile outreach programs that reach MSM at bars, shelters, parks, and other informal venues.**\nmHealth tools that enable self-testing, automated reminders, digital counselling, and anonymous referrals.**\nPeer- and community-led delivery models that build on local trust and engagement.**\n\nThese approaches reduce dependency on overburdened clinic systems and actively challenge structural barriers to care. Decentralization not only expands reach—it also supports equity by meeting people where they are.\n\n\n\nOur current knowledge synthesis work investigates how decentralized PrEP delivery models are being implemented for MSM in LMICs. This work emerges at a time when global momentum is accelerating around PrEP expansion, differentiated service delivery, and digital health—particularly with a growing emphasis on key populations in HIV prevention strategies. While research on PrEP delivery models has grown, MSM in LMICs remain significantly underrepresented in both global syntheses and implementation evidence. This work helps to fill that gap by centring their experiences and the models designed to reach them.\nThis work seeks to:\n\nIdentify innovative and underreported models currently in use or under development\nExamine how these programs adapt to legal, cultural, infrastructural, and political constraints\nAnalyze key outcomes such as uptake, retention, user satisfaction, and provider engagement\nSurface lessons from community-led and task-shifted models, especially those reaching underserved MSM subgroups\nTranslate findings into insights that inform future programs, funding decisions, and national HIV strategies\n\n\n\n\nThis project highlights the importance of building health systems that respond to the lived realities of MSM, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments. We focus on delivery approaches that:\n\nCenter community knowledge and peer trust\nMinimize logistical, financial, and social barriers to prevention\nAddress the impact of surveillance, fear, and criminalization\nLeverage technology thoughtfully while considering digital divides\nPromote human dignity and user agency within HIV prevention systems\nEngage MSM communities in co-designing and adapting services that reflect local values, norms, and needs.\n\nBy understanding how decentralized models operate on the ground, this work contributes to more resilient, responsive, and equitable health systems—particularly for people pushed to the margins of care.\n\n\n\nThis work addresses one of the most pressing challenges in global HIV prevention: how to expand access to PrEP for populations consistently left behind by traditional health systems. Despite the proven effectiveness of PrEP, structural, social, and legal barriers continue to prevent MSM in low- and middle-income countries from benefiting equally.\nBy investigating decentralized, community-centred, and digitally enabled PrEP delivery models, this knowledge synthesis contributes to public health in several key ways:\n\nSupports evidence-informed innovation by identifying real-world models that extend beyond clinic walls and meet MSM where they are.\n\nElevates implementation strategies that promote equity, reduce stigma, and operate effectively in legally or socially hostile environments.\n\nProvides actionable insights for program implementers, NGOs, and policymakers seeking scalable, context-sensitive HIV prevention approaches.\n\nBridges the gap between research and practice by synthesizing diverse forms of knowledge—peer-reviewed evidence, grey literature, and community reports—to inform adaptable solutions.\n\nAdvances global health equity by centring the needs of MSM in LMICs, and reframing HIV prevention not just as access to medicine, but as access to dignity, autonomy, and safety.\n\nThis research aims to shift how we think about HIV prevention—not just in terms of medication and delivery, but in terms of systems design, trust-building, and community power. It contributes to the growing effort to align health equity, human rights, and universal access in the global response to HIV.\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon."

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Public Health with a concentration in Health Economics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and bring over six years of experience in research, data analytics, and applied public health practice. My current work includes evaluating behavioural interventions to increase sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China; leading international research on access to anaphylaxis treatment and emergency care readiness; and assessing tuberculosis screening strategies in remote Arctic communities in Canada.\nMy earlier work focused on pediatric allergy, immunology, and epidemiology. I examined coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy and risk factors for vaccine-induced allergic reactions, with the goal of supporting safe and inclusive immunization strategies. I also studied the impact of atopic dermatitis on the maternal–infant bond, reflecting an early interest in the psychosocial dimensions of chronic disease and the broader role of health systems. Across this work, I have developed expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research methods, integrating epidemiology, health systems research, implementation science, and the social and behavioural sciences. I take a mixed-methods approach not only as a research strategy, but as a reflection of the complexity inherent in public health inquiry.\nAt the core of my research is a commitment to equity and real-world impact. I aim to make evidence both accessible and actionable for healthcare providers, policymakers, and frontline implementers. By combining statistical analysis, qualitative inquiry, and systems thinking, I strive to build a more complete understanding of how health systems function and how they can be strengthened.

    "text": "Let’s Talk About STBBIs: What They Are, Why They Matter, and What You Can Do\nMay 10, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nSexual health is a part of health — full stop. Yet even in 2025, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain heavily stigmatized, misunderstood, and under-discussed. And because we don’t talk about them enough, we allow misinformation, fear, and shame to take the place of facts, care, and prevention.\nThis blog post is my small way of changing that — by starting with the basics, and by sharing some of my own perspective.\n\nWhat Are STBBIs?\nSTBBIs — short for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections — are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. They can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, as well as through needle sharing, blood transfusions (where screening is limited), or from a birthing parent to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\nSome of the most common STBBIs include:\n\nChlamydia\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\nHPV (Human Papillomavirus)\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2)\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)\nHepatitis B and C\n\nEach of these infections is different — in symptoms, transmission, and treatment — but they share one thing in common: they are all manageable, preventable, and in many cases, treatable.\n\n\nHow Common Are STBBIs?\nVery common — more common than most people think. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 million STIs are acquired every day worldwide. Many people living with STBBIs do not even know they have one, because symptoms are often mild or absent. This is why testing is so important.\nThe reality is: if you are sexually active, you could be at risk — regardless of age, gender, relationship status, or sexual orientation.\n\n\nWhy Should We Care?\nSTBBIs do not always cause symptoms right away. But left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences:\n\nInfertility\nChronic pain\nLiver disease and cancer (especially from hepatitis B and C)\nNeurological complications\nIncreased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV\n\nFor pregnant women, some STBBIs can lead to complications like miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital infections passed on to the baby.\nBut here is the good news: Most STBBIs can be easily tested for, and many can be cured or effectively managed with treatment. Early detection truly makes all the difference.\n\n\nA Personal Perspective: Living Between Two Worlds\nAs someone who has lived in both a high-income country like Canada and a lower-middle-income country like the Philippines, I have seen firsthand the contrast in how sexual health is treated, taught, and accessed.\nIn Canada, I was fortunate to receive comprehensive sexual education in high school. We were taught about family planning methods like condoms and birth control pills, how to access them, and even how to use them properly. I still remember the condom demonstration using a model — a moment filled with nervous laughter from students, but also one that left a lasting impression. That education, awkward or not, was useful — and lifesaving.\nCanada’s public health system also provides access to free sexual health clinics, where youth — including young girls — can access contraceptives, STBBI testing, and counselling without stigma or barriers. We were taught how to test, why it matters to know our status, and how to protect ourselves through safer sex or abstinence.\nIn the Philippines, the contrast is stark. Sexual health remains a deeply taboo topic, especially in schools and within families. Comprehensive sexual education is rare, and public conversations around STBBIs are even rarer. Access to testing, treatment, and prevention tools like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or even condoms can be limited — not just logistically, but culturally. The silence is loud, and the stigma can be overwhelming.\nThat contrast continues to fuel my commitment to public health. Because education should not be a luxury. Testing should not be a privilege. And silence should never be the barrier that keeps people from knowing their status and protecting themselves.\n\n\nWhat’s Holding Us Back?\nThe biggest barriers are not scientific — they are social.\nMany people delay or avoid testing not because they lack access, but because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of what others might think. Fear of being associated with something “dirty” or “irresponsible”.\nThat stigma can be even more intense in communities where sex is rarely discussed openly. I have seen this play out personally — especially in Southeast Asian and religious contexts. But staying silent only allows the problem to grow.\nThe truth is, STBBIs do NOT discriminate. They can affect anyone, regardless of how many partners you have had, how careful you are, or who you are. Risk is not about identity — it is about biology and behavior, and more importantly, about access to information and care.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do: Take Care, Without Shame\nHere is what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other:\n\nGet tested regularly. If you are sexually active, routine testing is part of responsible healthcare — just like going to the dentist or getting a physical.\nUse protection. Condoms and dental dams help prevent many STBBIs. They are not perfect, but they are effective.\nKnow your options. Vaccines exist for HPV and hepatitis B. HIV prevention tools like PrEP and PEP are life-changing for many.\nTalk about it. Honest conversations with partners — and within our communities — can break down stigma and build trust.\nGet informed. The more we understand, the less room there is for shame.\n\n\n\nA Final Word: Knowledge Is Power, and Silence Is a Risk We Can’t Afford\nTalking about STBBIs should not be controversial — it should be standard practice. These infections are common, treatable, and preventable. Yet every day, people are put at risk not because they lack protection, but because they lack information, access, and support.\nI have seen how the silence around sexual health can cause real harm. I have lived in systems that empower people to make informed choices — and systems that shame them into silence. And I can tell you this: when we stay quiet, we do not keep people safe — we leave them behind.\nBut we can choose something different.\nWe can choose to create communities where talking about sexual health is a sign of care, not shame. We can choose to push for better education, stronger services, and a healthcare system that leaves no one out. We can choose to get tested, get informed, and speak up — not just for ourselves, but for those who cannot yet do so safely.\nBecause knowledge is more than power — it is protection. It is freedom. And it is a form of love.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"
