    "text": "\\(~\\)\nSexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain a major global public health concern. Despite increasing awareness, testing rates for STIs—such as gonorrhea and chlamydia—remain low worldwide, especially among marginalized populations including men who have sex with men (MSM). The underdiagnosis of asymptomatic infections continues to pose a barrier to effective treatment and control.\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), multiple factors such as stigma, financial costs, and limited access to culturally sensitive services reduce uptake of testing. In East Asian contexts, MSM often face structural exclusion and high levels of stigma, limiting their engagement with formal health systems and contributing to gaps in prevention and care.\n\\(~\\)\n\n\nEmerging behavioural public health strategies, such as the pay-it-forward (PIF) model, are being evaluated to address these challenges. PIF provides free STI testing to individuals and invites them to voluntarily support others—through donations, messages of encouragement, or other prosocial actions—thus creating a community-driven model of support and care.\nThis approach aims to:\n\nDecentralize the financial burden of STI testing;\nFoster shared responsibility in promoting sexual health;\nCreate stigma-sensitive alternatives to traditional service delivery, particularly in LMICs.\n\nParallel to this, community engagement is conceptualized as voluntary actions that contribute to shared health goals, including advocacy, peer support, and participation in public health activities. Together, PIF and community engagement aim to enhance STI testing uptake, especially in hard-to-reach populations.\n\n\n\nMy current work involves the evaluation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the pay-it-forward strategy among MSM in China. This includes analysis of:\n\nSTI testing uptake across different behavioural intervention arms;\nGiving behaviours generated by the PIF model as indicators of community engagement;\nThe role of clinic-level and demographic moderators in shaping intervention effects;\nA digital PIF model integrated with self-sampling to increase accessibility in resource-constrained settings.\n\nThis research contributes to growing efforts in understanding how social innovation and behavioural science can strengthen public health responses to STBBIs.\n\\(~\\)\n\\(~\\)\nStay tuned — publications and data visualizations related to this work will be made available here soon."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why I Work in HIV and STBBIs: A Personal and Professional Journey\nMay 7, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nWhen I began studying molecular biology as an undergraduate, I carried with me a deep sense of purpose. Like many students entering the life sciences, I was driven by a dream — to one day help cure cancer. I believed that if I could just understand disease at its most fundamental level, I could be part of the solution to one of the world’s greatest medical challenges.\nWhat captivated me most was the human body itself — its elegance, its complexity. Even in a state of health, it felt like an intricate puzzle. But the moment pathology entered the picture, that complexity multiplied. I remember thinking how difficult it was to grasp the body’s inner workings even when nothing was wrong — how much more difficult, then, when disease was involved. That realization gave me a new kind of respect for the scientific process, and also, quietly, a sense of doubt.\nAs I progressed in my studies, that doubt grew. Despite decades of research and extraordinary investment, cancer remains without a cure. The more I learned, the more I understood that science — as powerful and beautiful as it is — doesn’t always move at the pace of our hopes. I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.\nFortunately, I had the chance to step outside the lab and explore something new.\nI began working as a research assistant at the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, contributing to studies in population health, allergy, and clinical immunology. It was there that I got my first glimpse into the world of public health — and it shifted everything. I saw how public health wasn’t just about understanding disease, but about preventing it, supporting communities, and creating conditions where people could thrive. It wasn’t abstract. It was immediate, and it was deeply human.\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.\nI was given the opportunity to work as an infectious disease epidemiologist for the Government of Manitoba. In that role, I collaborated with epidemiologists, public health advisors, laboratory scientists, and medical officers of health. Together, we faced an unfolding crisis, with decisions needing to be made in real time. The work was urgent, collaborative, and fast-paced — and for the first time, I felt like I had found where I belonged.\nUnlike non-communicable diseases, which often require slow, long-term strategies, infectious diseases demand immediate action. They require basic science, clinical insight, and social understanding to come together — and that balance resonated with me. The field touched everything I cared about: biology, policy, data, and, most of all, people.\nAfter my experience with COVID-19, my attention turned to another crisis — one that had been ongoing for decades, but still demanded far more action: HIV and sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs).\nFrom my molecular biology background, I knew how formidable HIV is as a virus. Its ability to mutate — thanks to its error-prone reverse transcriptase — makes it extremely difficult to treat permanently or prevent with a long-lasting vaccine. A cure remains elusive. But I also knew that despite the scientific challenges, we already have the tools to control HIV. What’s missing, too often, is access, education, and equity.\nSo I made a quiet promise to myself:\nIf I can’t cure HIV, then I will help contain it.\nThis work became even more personal to me when I reflected on where I came from. Growing up in an Asian community, I saw how sexual health was often considered shameful — something not to be talked about, let alone prioritized. In the Philippines, where I have deep ties, HIV incidence has been rising, especially among young people and men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite progress in many parts of the world, stigma continues to be one of the greatest barriers to prevention and care in Southeast Asia.\nBut the issue isn’t just cultural — it’s systemic.\nI think about the individuals who are afraid to get tested, not because they lack information, but because they fear judgment. I think about the communities that are left behind, blamed, or ignored. And I think about those who are forced to make unimaginable choices simply to survive.\nWhen I was just seven years old, I already knew of children my age who were selling sex. Not out of choice, but out of desperation — to afford school, to put food on the table, to care for their families. That reality has stayed with me ever since. It planted something in me — a quiet fire that still burns.\nI dedicate my work to those children.\nTo those who had no childhood, no protection, and no choice. They deserved better, and they still do.\nNow, as a graduate student at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, I’ve found a path that allows me to combine my scientific training with advocacy, compassion, and community. Through my work in HIV and STBBIs, I aim to contribute to a world where public health is not only evidence-based, but people-centered.\nMy goal is not just to publish academic papers. I want to translate knowledge into impact — whether that’s through infographics that explain complex concepts, educational materials that reach underserved communities, or accessible writing like this blog. This site is a space where I share what I’m learning and working on, and where I hope others can learn, too.\nMost importantly, it’s a space to keep asking the questions that matter:\n\nHow do we reduce transmission — not just scientifically, but equitably?\nHow do we support people living with HIV — medically, emotionally, and socially?\nHow do we dismantle the stigma that continues to surround sexual health?\n\nPublic health is not value-free. It is shaped by politics, by power, and by systems — and that’s what makes it both complicated and necessary. I don’t have all the answers. But I know I want to be part of the effort to ask better questions, to listen more carefully, and to act more boldly.\nThank you for being here — and for caring about this work, too.\n-Ayel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s Talk About STBBIs: What They Are, Why They Matter, and What You Can Do\nMay 10, 2025\n\\(~\\)\nSexual health is a part of health — full stop. Yet even in 2025, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) remain heavily stigmatized, misunderstood, and under-discussed. And because we don’t talk about them enough, we allow misinformation, fear, and shame to take the place of facts, care, and prevention.\nThis blog post is my small way of changing that — by starting with the basics, and by sharing some of my own perspective.\n\nWhat Are STBBIs?\nSTBBIs — short for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections — are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. They can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, as well as through needle sharing, blood transfusions (where screening is limited), or from a birthing parent to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\nSome of the most common STBBIs include:\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)\nChlamydia\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\nHepatitis B and C\nHPV (Human Papillomavirus)\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2)\n\nEach of these infections is different — in symptoms, transmission, and treatment — but they share one thing in common: they’re all manageable, preventable, and in many cases, treatable.\n\n\nHow Common Are STBBIs?\nVery common — more common than most people think. According to the WHO, more than 1 million STIs are acquired every day worldwide. Many people living with STBBIs don’t even know they have one, because symptoms are often mild or absent. That’s why testing is so important.\nThe reality is: if you’re sexually active, you could be at risk — regardless of age, gender, relationship status, or sexual orientation.\n\n\nWhy Should We Care?\nSTBBIs don’t always cause symptoms right away. But left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences:\n\nInfertility\nChronic pain\nLiver disease and cancer (especially from hepatitis B and C)\nNeurological complications\nIncreased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV\n\nFor pregnant individuals, some STBBIs can lead to complications like miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital infections passed on to the baby.\nBut here’s the good news: Most STBBIs can be easily tested for, and many can be cured or effectively managed with treatment. Early detection truly makes all the difference.\n\n\nA Personal Perspective: Living Between Two Worlds\nAs someone who has lived in both a high-income country like Canada and a lower-middle-income country like the Philippines, I’ve seen firsthand the contrast in how sexual health is treated, taught, and accessed.\nIn Canada, I was fortunate to receive comprehensive sexual education in high school. We were taught about family planning methods like condoms and birth control pills, how to access them, and even how to use them properly. I still remember the condom demonstration using a model — a moment filled with nervous laughter from students, but also one that left a lasting impression. That education, awkward or not, was useful — and lifesaving.\nCanada’s public health system also provides access to free sexual health clinics, where youth — including young girls — can access contraceptives, STBBI testing, and counselling without stigma or barriers. We were taught how to test, why it matters to know our status, and how to protect ourselves through safer sex or abstinence.\nIn the Philippines, the contrast is stark. Sexual health remains a deeply taboo topic, especially in schools and within families. Comprehensive sexual education is rare, and public conversations around STBBIs are even rarer. Access to testing, treatment, and prevention tools like PrEP or even condoms can be limited — not just logistically, but culturally. The silence is loud, and the stigma can be overwhelming.\nThat contrast continues to fuel my commitment to public health. Because education should not be a luxury. Testing should not be a privilege. And silence should never be the barrier that keeps people from knowing their status and protecting themselves.\n\n\nWhat’s Holding Us Back?\nThe biggest barriers aren’t scientific — they’re social.\nMany people delay or avoid testing not because they lack access, but because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of what others might think. Fear of being associated with something “dirty” or “irresponsible.”\nThat stigma can be even more intense in communities where sex is rarely discussed openly. I’ve seen this play out personally — especially in Southeast Asian and religious contexts. But staying silent only allows the problem to grow.\nThe truth is, STBBIs don’t discriminate. They can affect anyone, regardless of how many partners you’ve had, how careful you are, or who you are. Risk isn’t about identity — it’s about biology and behavior, and more importantly, about access to information and care.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do: Take Care, Without Shame\nHere’s what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other:\n\nGet tested regularly. If you’re sexually active, routine testing is part of responsible healthcare — just like going to the dentist or getting a physical.\nUse protection. Condoms and dental dams help prevent many STBBIs. They’re not perfect, but they’re effective.\nKnow your options. Vaccines exist for HPV and hepatitis B. HIV prevention tools like PrEP and PEP are life-changing for many.\nTalk about it. Honest conversations with partners — and within our communities — can break down stigma and build trust.\nGet informed. The more we understand, the less room there is for shame.\n\n\n\nA Final Word: Knowledge Is Power, and Silence Is a Risk We Can’t Afford\nTalking about STBBIs shouldn’t be controversial — it should be standard practice. These infections are common, treatable, and preventable. Yet every day, people are put at risk not because they lack protection, but because they lack information, access, and support.\nI’ve seen how the silence around sexual health can cause real harm. I’ve lived in systems that empower people to make informed choices — and systems that shame them into silence. And I can tell you this: when we stay quiet, we don’t keep people safe — we leave them behind.\nBut we can choose something different.\nWe can choose to create communities where talking about sexual health is a sign of care, not shame. We can choose to push for better education, stronger services, and a healthcare system that leaves no one out. We can choose to get tested, get informed, and speak up — not just for ourselves, but for those who can’t yet do so safely.\nBecause knowledge is more than power — it’s protection. It’s freedom. And it’s a form of love.\nThank you for being here. Let’s keep talking.\n-Ayel"
