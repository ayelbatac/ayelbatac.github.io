<div style="margin-top: 2rem;"></div>

I am a data scientist, epidemiologist, and health economist in training, committed to research that informs public health policy, advances health equity, and supports evidence-based decision-making. I am pursuing a Master of Science in Public Health (Health Economics) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and bring over six years of experience in research, data analytics, and applied public health practice. My current work includes evaluating behavioural interventions to increase sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, leading international research on anaphylaxis treatment access and emergency care readiness, and assessing tuberculosis screening strategies in remote Arctic communities in Canada.

My earlier work focused on paediatric allergy, immunology, and epidemiology. I examined COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and risk factors for vaccine-induced allergic reactions, with the goal of supporting safe and inclusive immunisation strategies. I also studied the impact of atopic dermatitis on the maternal-infant bond, reflecting an early interest in the psychosocial dimensions of chronic disease and the broader role of health systems. Across this work, I have developed expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research methods, combining epidemiology, health systems research, implementation science, and the social and behavioural sciences. I take a mixed methods approach not only as a research strategy, but also as a reflection of the complexity of public health inquiry.

At the core of my research is a commitment to equity and real-world impact. I aim to make evidence both accessible and actionable for healthcare providers, policymakers, and frontline implementers. By combining statistical analysis, qualitative inquiry, and systems thinking, I strive to build a more complete understanding of how health systems function and how they can be strengthened. My collaborations with researchers across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, as well as my publications in leading journals in allergy and clinical immunology, reflect a focus on translating knowledge into practice in ways that drive meaningful improvements in health outcomes, particularly for populations with the greatest need.
