<div style="margin-top: 2rem;"></div>

I am a data scientist, epidemiologist, and health economist in training, passionate about using research to inform public health policy, improve health equity, and drive evidence-based decision-making. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Public Health (Health Economics) at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and bring over seven years of experience in research, analytics, and applied public health.

My current work spans several urgent public health challenges: evaluating behavioural interventions to increase gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China; supporting risk communication and debrief initiatives related to mpox; contributing to the evaluation of tuberculosis screening efforts in high-incidence settings; and leading research on anaphylaxis treatment access and health system readiness, including global disparities in emergency care.

I have collaborated with researchers across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Italy, China, Japan, and Australia—contributing to projects rooted in epidemiology, evidence synthesis, and implementation research. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and aims to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world policy and practice.

Ultimately, I am committed to ensuring that the evidence we generate reaches the people who need it—whether that is frontline providers, decision-makers, or communities—and leads to meaningful, equitable improvements in health outcomes.
