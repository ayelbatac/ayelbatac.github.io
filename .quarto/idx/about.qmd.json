I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Public Health (Health Economics stream) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and bring over six years of experience in research, analytics, and applied public health.\n\nMy current work spans several urgent public health challenges: evaluating behavioural interventions to increase gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China; supporting risk communication and debrief initiatives related to mpox; contributing to tuberculosis screening efforts in high-incidence settings; and leading research on anaphylaxis treatment access and health system readiness, including global disparities in emergency care.\n\nI have collaborated with researchers across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Italy, China, Japan, and Australia—contributing to projects rooted in epidemiology, evidence synthesis, and implementation research. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and aims to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world policy and practice.\n\nUltimately, I am committed to ensuring that the evidence we generate reaches the people who need it—whether that is frontline providers, decision-makers, or communities—and leads to meaningful, equitable improvements in health outcomes.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n---\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n### <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Education</span>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n**Master of Science (MSc), Public Health (Health Economics)** *(In Progress)*  \nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London, London, United Kingdom  \n\n**Bachelor of Science (BSc)**  \nUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\n\n---\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n### <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Postgraduate Training</span>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n**Western Science and Epigenetics**  \nCarleton University and the University of Toronto, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\n**Indigenous Studies**  \nUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\n\n---\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n### <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Membership in professional and learned socities</span>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n**World Allergy Organization**, Junior Member\n\n**European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology**, Junior Member\n\n**Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology**, Scientific Student Associate\n\n---\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"></div>\n\n### COLLABORATIONS\n\nRecent external collaboration(s) on country/territory level.
