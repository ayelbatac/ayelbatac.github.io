I am particularly interested in STBBI and HIV prevention and control, with an emphasis on the structural, behavioural, and social determinants that shape health inequities.\n\nI also explore infectious disease prevention and response in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and low-resource settings. My current work includes evaluating pay-it-forward models as innovative behavioural interventions to improve access to gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among MSM, and I maintain broader interests in respiratory infections, including tuberculosis (TB), respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), influenza (flu), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While I have growing interests in implementation science and infectious disease modelling, my current focus lies in mixed-methods research, evidence synthesis, and epidemiological analysis. I am actively involved in knowledge translation (KT) and knowledge mobilization (KMb) efforts to bridge research into policy and practice and ensure that evidence informs real-world decision-making.\n\nIn addition to my work in infectious diseases, I have a longstanding interest in allergy and clinical immunology, especially in the areas of epidemiology, evidence synthesis, and the health economics of allergy medications. I am also interested in the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of HIV prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n\n$~$\n\n<h2 style=\"color: #1B153E; font-weight: 600; border-bottom: none; margin-bottom: 2rem;\">Current Research</h2>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;\">\n\n  <!-- STBBIs -->\n  <a href=\"stbbi.qmd\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n    <img src=\"stbbi.png\" alt=\"STBBIs\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\"\n         onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.05)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)';\"\n         onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none';\">\n  </a>\n\n  <!-- TB -->\n  <a href=\"tb.qmd\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n    <img src=\"tb.png\" alt=\"Tuberculosis\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\"\n         onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.05)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)';\"\n         onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none';\">\n  </a>\n\n  <!-- Mpox -->\n  <a href=\"mpox.qmd\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n    <img src=\"mpox.png\" alt=\"Mpox\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\"\n         onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.05)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)';\"\n         onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none';\">\n  </a>\n\n  <!-- Anaphylaxis -->\n  <a href=\"anaphylaxis.qmd\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n    <img src=\"anaphylaxis.png\" alt=\"Anaphylaxis\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\"\n         onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.05)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)';\"\n         onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none';\">\n  </a>\n\n</div>\n\n$~$\n\n## Research Interests\n\n- Social epidemiology of STBBIs and HIV  \n- Health equity among MSM and sex worker populations  \n- Respiratory infectious diseases (e.g., TB, RSV, flu, COVID-19)  \n- Infectious disease prevention and control in LMICs and low-resource settings  \n- Behavioural interventions for health service uptake (e.g., pay-it-forward)  \n- Mixed-methods research in public health and epidemiology  \n- Evidence synthesis (scoping and systematic reviews)  \n- Knowledge translation and knowledge mobilization (KT/KMb)  \n- Infectious disease modelling  \n- Implementation science  \n- Health economics and pharmacoeconomics (HIV, allergy)  \n- Allergy and clinical immunology (anaphylaxis, asthma, drug and food allergy)  \n\n## Research Areas\n\n- Epidemiology (communicable and non-communicable diseases)  \n- Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infections (STBBIs)  \n- HIV/AIDS  \n- Public Health  \n- Infectious Diseases  \n- Global Health  \n- Health Systems Research  \n- Health Economics and Outcomes Research  \n- Implementation Science  \n- Knowledge Translation and Mobilization  \n- Evidence Synthesis  \n- Allergy  \n- Clinical Immunology  \n- Pediatrics  \n\n## Keywords\n\nSTBBIs, HIV/AIDS, MSM health, social epidemiology, behavioural interventions, LMICs, health equity, mixed-methods research, evidence synthesis, knowledge translation, knowledge mobilization, allergy, asthma, anaphylaxis, implementation science, mathematical modelling\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# RESEARCH\n\n## Research Summary\n\nMy research centers on the social epidemiology of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs), with a focus on marginalized and underserved populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex worker communities.
